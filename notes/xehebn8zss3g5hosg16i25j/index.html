<p>While it might not be possible to predict the future, it <em>is</em> possible for a strategy to side-step unpredictability through these mechanisms:</p>
<h3 id="build-a-moat"><a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/predict-the-future/#build-moat">Build a moat</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#build-a-moat"></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/moats/">Covered in this companion article</a>, a “moat” is a long-term, durable competitive advantage. A structural advantage that others cannot disrupt, lasting for years, is resilient to the volatility of your competitive market.</p>
<h3 id="have-more-than-one-way-to-succeed">Have more than one way to succeed<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#have-more-than-one-way-to-succeed"></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/capturing-luck/">A resilient plan is built of “or” not “and.”</a> We could reach customers through social media <em>or</em> paid advertisement <em>or</em> influencer marketing <em>or</em> channel sales. A product that at least <em>could</em> be sold in all those ways is more likely to succeed than a product which can only be sold a single way.</p>
<p>Optionality defeats unpredictability:</p>
<ul>
<li>A product that is very low cost to create has many <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/pricing-determines-your-business-model/">options for pricing</a>, and therefore more likely to find effective pricing.</li>
<li>A product in a large, growing market has many niches and personas and channels to potentially target, and therefore it’s more likely you’ll find some combination that works.</li>
<li>Some indie developers build multiple small products, then pour their effort into whichever one happens to take off.</li>
</ul>
<p>More examples are given in Nassim Taleb’s concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility">Antifragility</a>. In his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you “have optionality,” you don’t have much need for what is commonly called intelligence, knowledge, insight, skills, and these complicated things that take place in our brain cells. For you don’t have to be right that often. All you need is the wisdom to not do unintelligent things to hurt yourself (some acts of omission) and recognize favorable outcomes when they occur.<br>
—Nassim Taleb, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680/?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&#x26;utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&#x26;utm_medium=post">Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder</a></em> (2014)</p>

<h3 id="hedged-bets"><a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/predict-the-future/#hedged-bets">Hedged bets</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#hedged-bets"></a></h3>
<p>If you buy 30-year life insurance and live for 60 more years, you will make far more money than the insurance costs, so you come out ahead. If you buy 30-year life insurance and die in 2 years, your family will receive far more money than the insurance costs, so you come out ahead. Thus “insurance” is a way to always come out ahead, without predicting the future.</p>
<p>The catch: You’ve reduced your maximum upside. In the 60-year case, you paid insurance premiums for 30 years while receiving no money in return. On balance, however, this “tax” is worth it, because you’re <strong>trading slightly less maximum upside for predictable, net-positive outcomes.</strong></p></div></div><div
