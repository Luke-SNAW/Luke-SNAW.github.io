<p>Whether you’re a student, a teacher, or a parent, I think you’ll appreciate this story of how one teacher can completely and permanently change someone’s life in only a few lessons.</p>
<p>I was seventeen and about to start my first year at Berklee College of Music.</p>
<p>I called a local recording studio with a random question about music typesetting.</p>
<p>When the studio owner heard I was going to Berklee, he said, “I graduated from Berklee and taught there, too. I’ll bet I can teach you two years of theory and arranging in only a few lessons. I suspect you can graduate in two years if you understand there’s no speed limit. Come by my studio at 9:00 tomorrow for your first lesson, if you’re interested. No charge.”</p>
<p>Graduate college in two years? Awesome! I liked his style. That was <a href="https://jkimowilliams.com/">Kimo Williams</a>.</p>
<p>I showed up at his studio at 8:40 the next morning, super excited, though I waited outside before ringing his bell at 8:59.</p>
<p>He opened the door. A tall man in a Hawaiian shirt and a big hat, with a square scar on his nose, a laid-back demeanor, and a huge smile, sizing me up, nodding.</p>
<p>(Recently I heard him tell the story from his perspective. He said, “My doorbell rang at 8:59 one morning and I had no idea why. I run across kids all the time who say they want to be a great musician. I tell them I can help, and tell them to show up at my studio at 9:00 if they’re serious. Nobody ever does. It’s how I weed out the really serious ones from the kids who just talk. But there was Derek, ready to go.”)</p>
<p>After a one-minute welcome, we were sitting at the piano, analyzing the sheet music for a jazz standard. He was quickly explaining the chords based on the diatonic scale — how the dissonance of the tri-tone in the 5-chord with the flat-7 is what makes it want to resolve to the 1. Within a minute, he started quizzing me.</p>
<p>“If the 5-chord with the flat-7 has that tri-tone, then so does another flat-7 chord. Which one?”</p>
<p>“Uh… the flat-2 chord?”</p>
<p>“Right! So that’s a substitute chord. Any flat-7 chord can be substituted with the other flat-7 that shares the same tri-tone. So reharmonize all the chords you can in this chart. Go.”</p>
<p><strong>The pace was intense, and I loved it.</strong> Finally, someone was challenging me — keeping me in over my head — encouraging and expecting me to pull myself up quickly. I was learning so fast, it felt like the adrenaline rush you get while playing a video game. He tossed every fact at me and made me prove that I got it.</p>
<p>In our three-hour lesson that morning, he taught me a full semester of Berklee’s harmony courses. In our next four lessons, he taught me the next four semesters of harmony and arranging classes.</p>
<p>When I got to college and took my entrance exams, I tested out of those six semesters of requirements.</p>
<p>Then, as Kimo suggested, I bought the course materials for other required classes and taught myself, doing the homework in my own time. Then I went to the department head and took the final exam, getting full credit for those courses.</p>
<p>By doing this in addition to completing my full course load, I graduated college in two and a half years. I got my bachelor’s degree when I was twenty.</p>
<p>Kimo’s high expectations set a new pace for me. He taught me that “<strong>the standard pace is for chumps</strong>” — that the system is designed so anyone can keep up. <strong>If you’re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects.</strong> And this principle applies to all of life, not just school.</p>
<p>Before I met Kimo, I was just a kid who wanted to be a musician, doing it casually. Ever since our five lessons, I’ve had no speed limit. I owe every great thing that’s happened in my life to Kimo’s raised expectations. A random meeting and five music lessons showed me that I can do way more than the norm.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, Berklee invited me to give the opening keynote speech to incoming first-year students. Go to <a href="https://sive.rs/berklee">sive.rs/berklee</a> to see it. Kimo knows how much he means to me, and we’re friends to this day.</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ant-divider ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div><footer class="ant-layout-footer" style="padding:0 24px 24px"></footer></main></section></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"note":{"id":"g4qba3jbol2l8chactuadpc","title":"There's no speed limit","desc":"","updated":1661123958377,"created":1661123920132,"custom":{},"fname":"life-tips.there-is-no-speed-limit","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"e3914c6f8414d6a2843d289590137072","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":[],"parent":"ettkt3iClONnxpbGwBVLl","data":{}},"body":"\u003ch1 id=\"theres-no-speed-limit\"\u003eThere's no speed limit\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#theres-no-speed-limit\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://sive.rs/kimo\"\u003ehttps://sive.rs/kimo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether you’re a student, a teacher, or a parent, I think you’ll appreciate this story of how one teacher can completely and permanently change someone’s life in only a few lessons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was seventeen and about to start my first year at Berklee College of Music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called a local recording studio with a random question about music typesetting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the studio owner heard I was going to Berklee, he said, “I graduated from Berklee and taught there, too.
