<li>Do this 3x a week, with at least one rest day (or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/skillday">skill day</a>) in between workout days.</li>
<li>So you could do it Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Or Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. Or Wednesday, Friday, Sunday. Whatever fits your schedule.</li>
<li>Don't purposely split the workout into separate days. It's meant to be a full body workout. Here's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/6talge/split_routines_tend_to_be_suboptimal_for_beginners/">why</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-progressions-work">How Progressions Work<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-progressions-work"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>You cannot adjust the difficulty of bodyweight exercises like with weight training by simply adding or removing plates of weight. Therefore, in order to effectively increase or decrease the difficulty, you need to use different variations of a type of exercise. For an example in the push-up progression, some people may find a push-up on its own too difficult, and some may find it too easy. Therefore, variations of the pushup exist to make it easer (e.g. incline push-ups) or harder (decline, diamond, ring, pseudo planche etc. push-ups) so that you can pick a variation that is appropriate to your strength level, rather than simply doing an exercise that may be far too easy to make you get stronger, or far too hard to do properly.</li>
<li>When you get to the strength training, you will be greeted with progression exercises listed in order of increasing difficulty. Pick an appropriately difficult progression for your current level of strength, and perform 3 sets of 5 reps of that progresssion on your first session. In subsequent sessions you should try to add one rep per set until you are performing 3 sets of 8 reps with good form. From here you should move on to the next progression, but again at 3 sets of 5 reps. Note that this means that you only perform <em>one</em> of the exercises from each of the listed progressions in each session. Once you move up in the progression, there's no need to keep the easier exercises in your routine (except for using it as a warm-up if you feel like it).</li>
<li>Some of the exercises are static holds, such as the support holds or the "tuck front lever" in the rowing progression. Instead of dynamic reps, one set here consists of simply holding the position statically for 10-30 seconds. Move on to the next harder progression once you hit 30 seconds for all 3 sets.</li>
<li>You'll see there are multiple "progression paths" for the exercises. However, don't overthink this - if you're not sure pick the main progression and do it. If for some reason you can't follow the main progression (lack of specific equipment, for example) then pick one of the alternatives and do it.</li>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> There are nine exercises. These exercises are to be done in pairs and triplets to save time. Pairing two exercises means doing a set of the first exercise, resting 90 seconds, then doing a set of the second exercise, resting 90 seconds, and repeating until you've done 3 sets of that pair. For the triplet, you do a set of the first exercise, rest 60 seconds, do a set of the second exercise, rest 60 seconds, do a set of the third exercise, rest 60 seconds, and repeating until you've done 3 sets of that triplet. See the FAQs below if you're still confused.</p>
<p><strong>Rest time:</strong> If 90 seconds is not enough, you can rest up to 3 minutes if you like.</p>
<p><strong>Tempo:</strong> Ideally, all these exercises are to be done in a "10X0" (1,0,X,O) tempo. If this looks confusing, don't worry. The numbers explain how long each phase should last, and go in the order of: On the way Down/Pause at the Bottom/On the way up/Pause at the top. So 10X0 means 1 'mississippi' second duration on the way down, no pause at the bottom, eXplode up and no pause at the top. When "exploding up", if the actual movement is slow, that's okay, it's the intent that matters.</p>
<p>Overall, if your pull-up max is say 8 reps, then go for one rep short of failure such as 7-7-7 instead of 8-6-5. The key is to not work at failure for the first set or two because it significantly detracts from performance in later sets which reduces your ability to perform good reps and maximize volume to get stronger and bigger muscles. The 90 second pairing is so that there is minimum 3 minutes rest between each set, which is 3 minutes total. This rest time is where there is 99% replenishment of ATP in the muscles, so you are not limited by fatigue in the muscles. Sticking with failure-1 repetitions and 3 total minutes between sets of the same exercise allows you to maximize volume and effort level which is essential for strength and hypertrophy.

<h3 id="i-dont-have-this-much-time"><strong>I Don't Have This Much Time!</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#i-dont-have-this-much-time"></a></h3>
<p>This routine is about an hour long if you don't mess around and do the work. As a general rule, you should try and find this time somewhere. Make it a priority.<br>
However, if it's really not happening, here are the things you can do in order of not-badness (the further down the list, the more "last ditch effort" it becomes):</p>
<ul>
<li>Make triplets rather than pairs, like pull-ups, rest 50s, squats, rest 50s, dips, rest 50s, repeat. (saves ~10 minutes, but not recommended.)</li>
<li>Do just the warm-up, and a single triplet (so cut six exercises). (saves ~10 minutes, but really, really not recommended)</li>
<li>Don't workout at all (saves anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes, but really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really not recommended)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="integrating-barbell-squats-and-deadlifts"><strong>Integrating Barbell Squats and Deadlifts</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#integrating-barbell-squats-and-deadlifts"></a></h3>
<p>The basic process works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>You replace the squat progression by <em>squats</em>, 3 sets of 5 repetitions.</li>
<li>The 1st and 3rd workout of the week, you replace the hinge progression by <em>romanian deadlifts (weighted)</em>, 3 set of 8 repetitions.</li>
<li>The 2nd workout of the week, you replace the hinge progression by <em>deadlifts</em>, 3 sets of 5 repetitions.
So every week, you will be squatting thrice, romanian deadlifting twice, and deadlifting once
Before you do your "work sets" it's a good idea to warm up with less weight for squats and deadlifts: first do a bunch of reps with just the bar, then add weight and do another (slightly smaller) bunch of reps, then add more weight and do another (smaller still) bunch of reps, etc. until you are at the weight you want to be squatting at.
As for actually selecting a weight: the first time, start with just the bar. Then add weights in increments you feel comfortable with. Try to add some weight every workout at first.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, as long as you leave the warm-up in the warm-up, and the strength work in the strength work.</p>
<h3 id="when-do-i-move-on-to-an-intermediate-routine"><strong>When do I move on to an intermediate routine?</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#when-do-i-move-on-to-an-intermediate-routine"></a></h3>
<p>When you start plateauing (not making progress) for long periods of time (weeks) while your diet, nutrition, and stress levels are in check. You can also move on if you exhaust all the progressions. Or whenever you feel like, but that may not be optimal.</p>
<p>As to what intermediate routine you should do, that depends on your goals. If you don't know what those are, you'd better start thinking about it! Bodyweight training is very varied, and this routine will have given you a solid basis for most other things you might want to get into. We recommend you develop your own intermediate routine. A short guide can be found <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/training_guide#wiki_developing_an_intermediate_routine">here</a>.</p>

<p>No. If it were more effective that way, we wouldn't have made it a 3x a week routine. For more elaboration, see the FAQ on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_can_i_train_everyday.3F">can I train every day?</a></p>

<p>In your ability to do the exercises, expect progress to start about 2-3 workouts in. Physique progress, 4-6 weeks for you to notice it yourself, 12+ weeks for someone else to notice it. Provided your diet is in check.</p>
<h3 id="wheres-the-work-for-the-arms-and-shoulders"><strong>Where's the work for the arms and shoulders?</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#wheres-the-work-for-the-arms-and-shoulders"></a></h3>
<p>How are you planning on doing push-ups, rows, dips, and pull-ups without arms? Seriously though, all the exercises in the strength section are compound exercises, meaning they use major muscle groups simultaneously. Most bodyweight exercises are like this (as opposed to isolation exercises). Pushups, dips use the chest and triceps. Pullups and rows use the upper back (lats, etc), biceps and forearms (by gripping). If you want more work for your forearms, check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/griptraining">/r/griptraining</a>.</p>

<p>You can make whatever changes you like, but if there was something we could change in the routine to improve results right off the bat for everyone, we would have changed that. The routine is set up in the way it is for various reasons that are too complicated to get into here, and very few of the design decisions were arbitrary. If you don't know what you're doing, stick with the routine as written. If you want to learn more about why the routine is set up the way it is, start reading the Basic Programming Principles in our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/weekly/conceptwednesday">Concept Wednesday</a> series.</p>

<p>Give it some time. Make sure you're doing the hardest progressions you can do for 3 sets of 5 to 8 reps. This can take some figuring out in the beginning, so stick with it for a couple weeks and then reevaluate. Besides, soreness does not necessarily equate to growth.</p>

<p>The general consensus is that the Startbodyweight routine is a solid routine for all of strength, hypertrophy, and fat loss (provided you eat correctly), so it doesn't really matter, so pick one and <em>get going</em>. Indecision is no use if you're not working out.</p>

<p><strong>Pairs are sets of exercises combined together by switching after every set instead of doing 3 sets of 1 exercise, and then 3 sets of another. This saves overall time.</strong></p>
<p>This is how it should be done:</p>
<p>First pair: Pull-Ups &#x26; Squats</p>
<pre><code>Pull-Ups, rest 90sec, Squats, rest 90sec
Pull-Ups, rest 90sec, Squats, rest 90sec
Pull-Ups, rest 90sec, Squats, rest 90sec
</code></pre>
<p>Second pair Dips &#x26; Hinge</p>
<pre><code>Dips, rest 90sec, Hinge, rest 90sec
Dips, rest 90sec, Hinge, rest 90sec
Dips, rest 90sec, Hinge, rest 90sec
</code></pre>
<p>Third pair: Rows &#x26; Push-ups</p>
<pre><code>Rows, rest 90sec, Push-ups, rest 90sec
Rows, rest 90sec, Push-ups, rest 90sec
Rows, rest 90sec, Push-ups, rest 90sec
</code></pre>
<p>Core Triplet</p>

Therefore, in order to effectively increase or decrease the difficulty, you need to use different variations of a type of exercise. For an example in the push-up progression, some people may find a push-up on its own too difficult, and some may find it too easy. Therefore, variations of the pushup exist to make it easer (e.g. incline push-ups) or harder (decline, diamond, ring, pseudo planche etc. push-ups) so that you can pick a variation that is appropriate to your strength level, rather than simply doing an exercise that may be far too easy to make you get stronger, or far too hard to do properly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen you get to the strength training, you will be greeted with progression exercises listed in order of increasing difficulty. Pick an appropriately difficult progression for your current level of strength, and perform 3 sets of 5 reps of that progresssion on your first session. In subsequent sessions you should try to add one rep per set until you are performing 3 sets of 8 reps with good form. From here you should move on to the next progression, but again at 3 sets of 5 reps. Note that this means that you only perform \u003cem\u003eone\u003c/em\u003e of the exercises from each of the listed progressions in each session. Once you move up in the progression, there's no need to keep the easier exercises in your routine (except for using it as a warm-up if you feel like it).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSome of the exercises are static holds, such as the support holds or the \"tuck front lever\" in the rowing progression. Instead of dynamic reps, one set here consists of simply holding the position statically for 10-30 seconds. Move on to the next harder progression once you hit 30 seconds for all 3 sets.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou'll see there are multiple \"progression paths\" for the exercises.

These exercises are to be done in pairs and triplets to save time. Pairing two exercises means doing a set of the first exercise, resting 90 seconds, then doing a set of the second exercise, resting 90 seconds, and repeating until you've done 3 sets of that pair. For the triplet, you do a set of the first exercise, rest 60 seconds, do a set of the second exercise, rest 60 seconds, do a set of the third exercise, rest 60 seconds, and repeating until you've done 3 sets of that triplet. See the FAQs below if you're still confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRest time:\u003c/strong\u003e If 90 seconds is not enough, you can rest up to 3 minutes if you like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTempo:\u003c/strong\u003e Ideally, all these exercises are to be done in a \"10X0\" (1,0,X,O) tempo. If this looks confusing, don't worry. The numbers explain how long each phase should last, and go in the order of: On the way Down/Pause at the Bottom/On the way up/Pause at the top. So 10X0 means 1 'mississippi' second duration on the way down, no pause at the bottom, eXplode up and no pause at the top. When \"exploding up\", if the actual movement is slow, that's okay, it's the intent that matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, if your pull-up max is say 8 reps, then go for one rep short of failure such as 7-7-7 instead of 8-6-5. The key is to not work at failure for the first set or two because it significantly detracts from performance in later sets which reduces your ability to perform good reps and maximize volume to get stronger and bigger muscles. The 90 second pairing is so that there is minimum 3 minutes rest between each set, which is 3 minutes total. This rest time is where there is 99% replenishment of ATP in the muscles, so you are not limited by fatigue in the muscles. Sticking with failure-1 repetitions and 3 total minutes between sets of the same exercise allows you to maximize volume and effort level which is essential for strength and hypertrophy.

Most bodyweight exercises are like this (as opposed to isolation exercises). Pushups, dips use the chest and triceps. Pullups and rows use the upper back (lats, etc), biceps and forearms (by gripping).
