<p>Not very long ago I gave a talk about the clean architecture on frontend. In this post, I'm summarizing that talk and expanding it a bit with details and concepts I didn't have time to explain.</p>
<p>I'll put links here to all sorts of useful stuff that will come in handy as you read:</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="whats-the-plan">What's the Plan<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#whats-the-plan">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#whats-the-plan"></a></h2>
<p>First, we'll talk about what the clean architecture is in general and get familiar with such concepts as domain, use case and application layers. Then we'll discuss how this applies to the frontend and whether it's worth it at all.</p>
<p>Next, we'll design the frontend for a cookie store following the rules of the clean architecture. And finally, we'll implement one of the use cases from scratch to see if it's usable.</p>
<p>The store will use React as its UI framework just to show that this approach can be used with it as well. (And because the talk this post is based on was addressed to developers who already use React 😄) Although React is not necessary, you can use everything I show in this post with other UI libs or frameworks too.</p>
<p>There will be a little TypeScript in the code, but only to show how to use types and interfaces to describe entities. Everything we'll look at today can be used without TypeScript, except the code won't be as expressive.</p>
<p>We will hardly talk about OOP today, so this post should not cause any severe allergies. We will only mention OOP once at the end, but it won't stop us from designing an application.</p>
<p>Also, we'll skip tests today because they are not the main topic of this post. I will keep in mind testability though and mention how to improve it along the way.</p>
<p>And finally, this post is mostly about you grasping the concept of clean architecture. The examples in the post are simplified, so it isn't literal instruction on how to write the code. Understand the idea and think about how you can apply these principles in your projects.</p>
<p>At the end of the post, you can find a list of methodologies that are related to clean architecture and used on the frontend more widely. So you can find a best fit depending on the size of your project.</p>
<p>And now, let's dig in!</p>
<h2 id="architecture-and-design">Architecture and Design<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#architecture-and-design">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#architecture-and-design"></a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Designing is fundamentally about taking things apart... in such a way that they can be put back together. ...Separating things into things that can be composed that's what design is.<br>
— Rich Hickey. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Design-Composition-Performance/">Design Composition and Performance</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>System design, says the quote in the epigraph, is the system separation so that it can be reassembled later. And most importantly, be assembled <em>easily, without too much work</em>.</p>
<p>I agree. But I consider another goal of an architecture to be the extensibility of the system. The demands on the program are constantly changing. We want the program to be easy to update and modify to meet new requirements. The clean architecture can help achieve this goal.</p>
<h2 id="the-clean-architecture">The Clean Architecture<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#the-clean-architecture">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-clean-architecture"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">The clean architecture</a> is a way of separating responsibilities and parts of functionality according to their proximity to the application domain.</p>
<p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_knowledge">the domain</a>, we mean the part of the real world that we model with a program. This is the data transformations that reflect transformations in the real world. For example, if we updated the name of a product, replacing the old name with the new one is a domain transformation.</p>
<p>The Clean Architecture is often referred to as a three-layer architecture, because the functionality in it is divided into layers. The original post about <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">The Clean Architecture</a> provides a diagram with the layers highlighted:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html"><img src="/images/content/clean-architecture-on-frontend/clean-architecture-diagram.jpg" alt="Layer diagram: the domain is in the center, the application layer around it, and the adapters layer on the outside"></a></p>
<p>Layer diagram: the domain is in the center, the application layer around it, and the adapters layer on the outside</p>
<h3 id="domain-layer">Domain Layer<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#domain-layer">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#domain-layer"></a></h3>
<p>At the center is <a href="https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/#domain-layer">the domain layer</a>. It is the entities and data that describe the subject area of the application, as well as the code to transform that data. The domain is the core that distinguishes one application from another.</p>
<p>You can think of the domain as something that won't change if we move from React to Angular, or if we change some use case. In the case of the store, these are products, orders, users, cart, and functions to update their data.</p>
<p>The data structure of domain entities and the essence of their transformations are independent from the outer world. External events <em>trigger domain transformations</em>, but <em>do not determine</em> how they will occur.</p>
<p>The function of adding an item to cart doesn't care how exactly the item was added: by the user himself through the “Buy” button or automatically with a promo code. It will in both cases accept the item and return an updated cart with the added item.</p>
<h3 id="application-layer">Application Layer<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#application-layer">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#application-layer"></a></h3>
<p>Around the domain is <a href="https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/#application-layer">the application layer</a>. This layer describes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case">use cases</a>, i.e. user scenarios. They are responsible for what happens after some event occurs.</p>
<p>For example, the “Add to cart” scenario is a use case. It describes the actions that are should be taken after the button is clicked. It's the kind of “orchestrator” that says:</p>
<ul>
<li>go to the server, send a request;</li>
<li>now perform this a domain transformation;</li>
<li>now redraw the UI using the response data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, in the application layer theree are <a href="https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/#ports">ports</a>—the specifications of how <em>our application wants</em> the outside world to communicate with it. Usually a port is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)#Software_interfaces">interface</a>, a behavior contract.</p>
<p>Ports serve as a “buffer zone” between our application's wishes and the reality. Input Ports tell us how the application <em>wants</em> to be contacted by the outside world. Output Ports say how the application <em>is going to</em> communicate with the outside world to make it ready.</p>
<p>We will look at ports in more detail later.</p>
<h3 id="adapters-layer">Adapters Layer<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#adapters-layer">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#adapters-layer"></a></h3>
<p>The outermost layer contains the <a href="https://herbertograca.com/2017/09/14/ports-adapters-architecture/">adapters</a> to external services. Adapters are needed to turn incompatible APIs of external services into those compatible with our application's wishes.</p>
<p>Adapters are a great way to lower the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)">coupling</a> between our code and the code of third-party services. Low coupling reduces needs to change one module when others are changed.</p>
<p>Adapters are often divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li>driving—which <em>send signals to</em> our application;</li>
<li>driven—which <em>receive the signals from</em> our application.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The user</em> interacts most often with driving adapters. For example, the UI framework's handling of a button click is the work of a driving adapter. It works with the browser API (basically a third-party service) and converts the event into a signal that our application can understand.</p>
<p>Driven adapters interact with the <em>infrastructure</em>. In the frontend, most of the infrastructure is the backend server, but sometimes we may interact with some other services directly, such as a search engine.</p>
<p>Note that the farther we are from the center, the more “service-oriented” the code functionality is, the <em>farther it is from the domain knowledge</em> of our application. This will be important later on, when we decide which layer any module should belong to.</p>
<h3 id="dependency-rule">Dependency Rule<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#dependency-rule">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dependency-rule"></a></h3>
<p>The three-layer architecture has a dependency rule: <em>only the outer layers can depend on the inner layers</em>. This means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the domain must be independent;</li>
<li>the application layer can depend on the domain;</li>
<li>the outer layers can depend on anything.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/"><img src="/images/content/clean-architecture-on-frontend/hex-pie.png" alt="Only the outer layers can depend on the inner layers"></a></p>
<p>Only the outer layers can depend on the inner layers</p>
<p>Sometimes this rule can be violated, although it is better not to abuse it. For example, it is sometimes convenient to use some “library-like” code in a domain, even though there should be no dependencies. We'll look at an example of this when we get to the source code.</p>
<p>An uncontrolled direction of dependencies can lead to complicated and confusing code. For example, breaking a dependency rule can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cyclic dependencies, where module A depends on B, B depends on C, and C depends on A.</li>
<li>Poor testability, where you have to simulate the whole system to test a small part.</li>
<li>Too high coupling, and as a consequence, brittle interaction between modules.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advantages-of-clean-architecture">Advantages of Clean Architecture<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#advantages-of-clean-architecture">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#advantages-of-clean-architecture"></a></h2>
<p>Now let's talk about what this separation of code gives us. It has several advantages.</p>
<h3 id="separate-domain">Separate domain<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#separate-domain">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#separate-domain"></a></h3>
<p>All the main application functionality is <em>isolated and collected</em> in one place—in the domain.</p>
<p>Functionality in the domain is independent, which means that it is easier to test. The less dependencies the module has, the less infrastructure is needed for testing, the less mocks and stubs are needed.</p>
<p>A stand-alone domain is also easier to test against business expectations. This helps new developers to grasp on what the application should do. In addition, a stand-alone domain helps look for errors and inaccuracies in the “translation” from the business language to the programming language more quickly.</p>
<h3 id="independent-use-cases">Independent Use Cases<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#independent-use-cases">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#independent-use-cases"></a></h3>
<p>Application scenarios, use cases are described separately. They dictate what third-party services we will need. We <em>adapt the outside world</em> to our needs, not the other way around. This gives us more freedom to choose third-party services. For example, we can quickly change the payment system if the current one starts charging too much.</p>
<p>The use case code also becomes flat, testable and extensible. We will see this in an example later on.</p>
<h3 id="replaceable-third-party-services">Replaceable Third-Party Services<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#replaceable-third-party-services">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#replaceable-third-party-services"></a></h3>
<p>External services become replaceable because of adapters. As long as we don't change the interface, it doesn't matter which external service implements the interface.</p>
<p>This way, we create a barrier to change propagation: changes in someone else's code do not directly affect our own. Adapters also <a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/patterns-for-fault-tolerant-software/">limit the propagation of bugs</a> in the application runtime.</p>
<h2 id="costs-of-clean-architecture">Costs of Clean Architecture<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#costs-of-clean-architecture">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#costs-of-clean-architecture"></a></h2>
<p>Architecture is first of all a tool. Like any tool, the clean architecture has its costs besides its benefits.</p>
<h3 id="takes-time">Takes Time<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#takes-time">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#takes-time"></a></h3>
<p>The main cost is time. It is required not only for design, but also for implementation, because it is always easier to call a third-party service directly than to write adapters.</p>
<p>It is also difficult to think through the interaction of all the modules of the system in advance, because we may not know all the requirements and constraints beforehand. When designing, we need to keep in mind how the system can change, and leave room for expansion.</p>
<h3 id="sometimes-overly-verbose">Sometimes Overly Verbose<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#sometimes-overly-verbose">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#sometimes-overly-verbose"></a></h3>
<p>In general, a canonical implementation of the clean architecture is not always convenient, and sometimes even harmful. If the project is small, a full implementation will be an overkill that will increase the entry threshold for newcomers.</p>
<p>You may need to make design tradeoffs to stay within budget or deadline. I'll show you by example exactly what I mean by such tradeoffs.</p>
<h2 id="can-make-onboarding-more-difficult">Can Make Onboarding More Difficult<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#can-make-onboarding-more-difficult">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#can-make-onboarding-more-difficult"></a></h2>
<p>Full implementation of the clean architecture can make the onboarding more difficult because any tool requires the knowledge on how to use it.</p>
<p>If you over-engineer at the beginning of a project, it will be harder to onboard new developers later. You have to keep this in mind and keep your code simple.</p>
<h2 id="can-increase-the-amount-of-code">Can Increase the Amount of Code<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#can-increase-the-amount-of-code">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#can-increase-the-amount-of-code"></a></h2>
<p>A problem specific for frontend is that the clean architecture can increase the amount of code in the final bundle. The more code we give to the browser, the more it has to download, parse and interpret.</p>
<p>The amount of code will have to be watched and decisions will have to be made about where to cut corners:</p>
<ul>
<li>maybe describe the use case a little simpler;</li>
<li>maybe access the domain functionality directly from the adapter, bypassing the use case;</li>
<li>maybe we'll have to tweak the code splitting, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-reduce-costs">How to Reduce Costs<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#how-to-reduce-costs">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-to-reduce-costs"></a></h2>
<p>You can reduce the amount of time and code by cutting corners and sacrificing the “cleanliness” of the architecture. I'm generally not a fan of radical approaches: if it's more pragmatic (e.g. benefits will be higher than potential costs) to break a rule, I'll break it.</p>
<p>So, you can balk at some aspects of the clean architecture for a while with no problem at all. The <em>minimum required</em> amount of resources, however, that are definitely worth devoting to are two things.</p>
<h3 id="extract-domain">Extract Domain<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#extract-domain">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#extract-domain"></a></h3>
<p>The extracted domain helps to understand <em>what</em> we are designing in general and how it should work. The extracted domain makes it easier for new developers to understand the application, its entities and relationships between them.</p>
<p>Even if we skip the other layers, it still will be easier to work and refactor with the extracted domain which is not spread over the code base. Other layers can be added as needed.</p>
<h3 id="obey-dependency-rule">Obey Dependency Rule<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#obey-dependency-rule">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#obey-dependency-rule"></a></h3>
<p>The second rule not to be discarded is the rule of dependencies, or rather their <em>direction</em>. External services must adapt to our need and never otherwise.</p>
<p>If you feel that you are "fine-tuning" your code so that it can call the search API, something is wrong. Better write an adapter before the problem spreads.</p>
<h2 id="designing-the-application">Designing the Application<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#designing-the-application">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#designing-the-application"></a></h2>
<p>Now that we've talked about theory, we can get down to practice. Let's design the architecture of a <a href="https://bespoyasov.me/showcase/frontend-clean-architecture/">cookie store</a>.</p>
<p>The store will sell different kinds of cookies, which may have different ingredients. Users will choose cookies and order them, and pay for the orders in a third-party payment service.</p>
<p>There will be a showcase of cookies that we can buy on the home page. We will only be able to buy cookies if we are authenticated. The login button will take us to a login page where we can log in.</p>
<p><img src="/images/content/clean-architecture-on-frontend/en/app.png" alt="Store main page"></p>
<p>Store main page</p>
<p>(Don't mind how it looks, I'm no web-designer 😄)</p>
<p>After a successful login we will be able to put some cookies in the cart.</p>
<p><img src="/images/content/clean-architecture-on-frontend/en/app-cart.png" alt="Cart with selected cookies"></p>
<p>Cart with selected cookies</p>
<p>When we've put the cookies in the cart, we can place the order. After payment, we get a new order in the list and a cleared shopping cart.</p>
<p>We'll implement the checkout use case. You can find the rest use cases in <a href="https://github.com/bespoyasov/frontend-clean-architecture/tree/master/src/application">the source code</a>.</p>
<p>First we'll define what kind of entities, use cases and functionality in the broad sense we'll have at all. Then let's decide which layer they should belong to.</p>
<h3 id="designing-domain">Designing Domain<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#designing-domain">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#designing-domain"></a></h3>
<p>The most important thing in an application is the domain. It is where the main entities of the application and their data transformations are. I suggest that you start with the domain in order to accurately represent the domain knowledge of the app in your code.</p>
<p>The store domain may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the data types of each entity: user, cookie, cart, and order;</li>
<li>the factories for creating each entity, or classes if you write in OOP;</li>
<li>and transformation functions for that data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The transformation functions in the domain should depend only on the rules of the domain and nothing else. Such functions would be, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>a function for calculating the total cost;</li>
<li>user's taste preference detection</li>
<li>determining whether an item is in the shopping cart, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The application layer contains the use cases. A use case always has an actor, an action, and a result.</p>
<p>In the store, we can distinguish:</p>
<ul>
<li>A product purchase scenario;</li>
<li>payment, calling third-party payment systems;</li>
<li>interaction with products and orders: updating, browsing;</li>
<li>access to pages depending on roles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use cases are usually described in terms of the subject area. For example, the “checkout” scenario actually consists of several steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>retrieve items from the shopping cart and create a new order;</li>
<li>pay for the order;</li>
<li>notify the user if the payment fails;</li>
<li>clear the cart and show the order.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use case function will be the code that describes this scenario.</p>
<p>Also, in the application layer there are ports—interfaces for communicating with the outside world.</p>

<p>In the adapters layer, we declare adapters to external services. Adapters make incompatible APIs of third-party services compatible to our system.</p>
<p>On the frontend, adapters are usually the UI framework and the API server request module. In our case we will use:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI-framework;</li>
<li>API request module;</li>
<li>Adapter for local storage;</li>
<li>Adapters and converters of API answers to the application layer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes it's hard to know which layer some data belongs to. A small (and incomplete!) analogy with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC</a> may help here:</p>
<ul>
<li>models are usually domain entities,</li>
<li>controllers are domain transformations and application layer,</li>
<li>view is driving adapters.</li>
</ul>
<p>The concepts are different in detail but quite similar, and this analogy can be used to define domain and application code.</p>

<p>Once we've determined <em>what</em> entities we'll need, we can start defining <em>how</em> they behave.</p>
<p>I'll show you the code structure in <a href="https://github.com/bespoyasov/frontend-clean-architecture/">project</a> right away. For clarity, I divide the code into folders-layers.</p>

<p>The domain is in the <code>domain/</code> directory, the application layer is in <code>application/</code>, and the adapters are in <code>services/</code>. We will discuss alternatives to this code structure at the end.</p>

<ul>
<li>product;</li>

<p>The main actor is the user. We will store data about the user in the storage during the session. We want to type this data, so we will create a domain user type.</p>
<p>The user type will contain ID, name, mail and lists of preferences and allergies.</p>

<p>The benefit of designing entity types in such a way is that we can already check whether their relationship diagram corresponds to reality:</p>
<p><img src="/images/content/clean-architecture-on-frontend/interaction.png" alt="Entity Relationship Diagram"></p>
<p>Entity Relationship Diagram</p>
<p>We can see and check:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the main actor is really a user,</li>
<li>if there is enough information in the order,</li>
<li>if some entity needs to be extended,</li>
<li>if there will be problems with extensibility in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, already at this stage, types will help highlight errors with the compatibility of entities with each other and the direction of signals between them.</p>
<p>If everything meets our expectations, we can start designing domain transformations.</p>
<h3 id="creating-data-transformations">Creating Data Transformations<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#creating-data-transformations">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#creating-data-transformations"></a></h3>
<p>All sorts of things will happen to the data whose types we've just designed. We will be adding items to the cart, clearing it, updating items and user names, and so on. We will create separate functions for all these transformations.</p>
<p>For example, to determine if a user is allergic to some ingredient or preference, we can write functions <code>hasAllergy</code> and <code>hasPreference</code>:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// domain/user.ts</span>

<span class="token keyword module">export</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">hasAllergy</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>user<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">User</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> ingredient<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Ingredient</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token builtin">boolean</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

<p>The functions <code>addProduct</code> and <code>contains</code> are used to add items to cart and check if an item is in cart:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// domain/cart.ts</span>

<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We also need to calculate the total price of the list of products—for this we will write the function <code>totalPrice</code>. If required, we can add to this function to account for various conditions, such as promo codes or seasonal discounts.</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// domain/product.ts</span>

</code></pre>
<p>To allow users to create orders, we will add the function <code>createOrder</code>. It will return a new order associated with a specified user and their cart.</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// domain/order.ts</span>

<span class="token keyword module">export</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">createOrder</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>user<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">User</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> cart<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Cart</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Order</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

</code></pre>
<p>Note that in every function we build the API so that <em>we</em> can comfortably transform the data. We take arguments and give the result as we want.</p>
<p>At the design stage, there are no external constraints yet. This allows us to reflect data transformations as close to the subject domain as possible. And the closer the transformations are to reality, the easier it will be to check their work.</p>

<p>You may have noticed some of the types we used when describing domain types. For example, <code>Email</code>, <code>UniqueId</code> or <code>DateTimeString</code>. These are <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#type-aliases">type-alias</a>:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// shared-kernel.d.ts</span>

<span class="token keyword">type</span> <span class="token class-name"><span class="token maybe-class-name">Email</span></span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">string</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">type</span> <span class="token class-name"><span class="token maybe-class-name">UniqueId</span></span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">string</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token keyword">type</span> <span class="token class-name"><span class="token maybe-class-name">PriceCents</span></span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">number</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>I usually use type-alias to get rid of <a href="https://refactoring.guru/smells/primitive-obsession">primitive obsession</a>.</p>
<p>I use <code>DateTimeString</code> instead of just <code>string</code>, to make it clearer what kind of string is used. The closer the type is to the subject area, the easier it will be to deal with errors when they occur.</p>
<p>The specified types are in the file <code>shared-kernel.d.ts</code>. <a href="http://ddd.fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors/view/domain-driven-design/view/shared-kernel"><em>Shared kernel</em></a> is the code and the data, dependency on which doesn't increase coupling between modules. More about this concept you can find in <a href="https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/">"DDD, Hexagonal, Onion, Clean, CQRS, ...How I put it all together"</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, the shared kernel can be explained like this. We use TypeScript, we use its standard type library, but we don't consider them as <em>dependencies</em>. This is because the modules that use them may not know anything about each other and remain decoupled.</p>
<p>Not all code can be classified as shared kernel. The main and most important limitation is that such code must be compatible with <em>any part of the system</em>. If a part of the application is written in TypeScript and another part in another language, the shared kernel may contain only code that can be used in both parts. For example, entity specifications in JSON format are fine, TypeScript helpers are not.</p>
<p>In our case, the entire application is written in TypeScript, so type-alias over built-in types can also be classified as shared kernel. Such globally available types do not increase coupling between modules and can be used in any part of the application.</p>
<h2 id="into-detail-application-layer">Into Detail: Application Layer<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#into-detail-application-layer">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#into-detail-application-layer"></a></h2>
<p>Now that we have the domain figured out, we can move on to the application layer. This layer contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case">use cases</a>.</p>
<p>In the code we describe the technical details of scenarios. A use case is a description of what should happen to the data after adding an item to cart or proceeding to checkout.</p>
<p>Use cases involve interaction with the outer world, and thus, the use of external services. Interactions with the outside world are side-effects. We know that it is easier to work with and debug functions and systems without side-effects. And most of our domain functions are already written as pure functions.</p>
<p>To combine clean transformations and interaction with the impure world, we can use the application layer as an impure context.</p>
<h3 id="impure-context-for-pure-transformations">Impure Context For Pure Transformations<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#impure-context-for-pure-transformations">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#impure-context-for-pure-transformations"></a></h3>
<p>An impure context for pure transformations is a code organization in which:</p>
<ul>
<li>we first perform a side-effect to get some data;</li>
<li>then we do a pure transformation on that data;</li>
<li>and then do a side-effect again to store or pass the result.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the “Put item in cart” use case, this would look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>first, the handler would retrieve the cart state from the store;</li>
<li>then it would call the cart update function, passing the item to be added;</li>
<li>and then it would save the updated cart in the storage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole process is a “sandwich”: side-effect, pure function, side-effect. The main logic is reflected in data transformation, and all communication with the world is isolated in an imperative shell.</p>
<p><img src="/images/content/clean-architecture-on-frontend/impureim.png" alt="Functional architecture: side-effect, pure function, side-effect"></p>
<p>Functional architecture: side-effect, pure function, side-effect</p>
<p>Impure context is sometimes called a functional core in an imperative shell. Mark Seemann <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/03/02/impureim-sandwich/">wrote about this in his blog</a>. This is the approach we will use when writing use case functions.</p>
<h3 id="designing-use-case">Designing Use Case<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#designing-use-case">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#designing-use-case"></a></h3>
<p>We will select and design the checkout use case. It is the most representative one because it is asynchronous and interacts with a lot of third-party services. The rest of the scenarios and the code of the whole application you can find on <a href="https://github.com/bespoyasov/frontend-clean-architecture">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Let's think about what we want to achieve in this use case. The user has a cart with cookies, when the user clicks the checkout button:</p>
<ul>
<li>we want to create a new order;</li>
<li>pay for it in a third-party payment system;</li>
<li>if the payment failed, notify the user about it;</li>
<li>if it passed, save the order on the server;</li>
<li>add the order to the local data store to show on the screen.</li>

<p>In terms of API and function signature, we want to pass the user and the cart as arguments, and have the function do everything else by itself.</p>

<p>Ideally, of course, the use case should not take two separate arguments, but a command that will encapsulate all the input data inside itself. But we don't want to bloat the amount of code, so we'll leave it that way.</p>

<p>Let's take a closer look at the steps of the use case: the order creation itself is a domain function. Everything else is external services that we want to use.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that it's the external services that have to adapt to our needs and not otherwise. So, in the application layer, we'll describe not only the use case itself, but also the interfaces to these external services—the ports.</p>
<p>The ports should be, first of all, convenient for our application. If the API of external services isn't compatible with our needs, we'll write an adapter.</p>
<p>Let's think of the services we will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>a payment system;</li>
<li>a service to notify users about events and errors;</li>
<li>a service to save data to the local storage.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/content/clean-architecture-on-frontend/ports.png" alt="Services we&#x27;re going to need"></p>
<p>Services we're going to need</p>
<p>Note that we are now talking about the <em>interfaces</em> of these services, not their implementation. At this stage, it is important for us to describe the required behavior, because this is the behavior we will rely on in the application layer when describing the scenario.</p>
<p>How exactly this behavior will be implemented is <em>not important</em> yet. This allows us to postpone the decision about which external services to use until the very last moment—this makes the code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29">minimally coupled</a>. We'll deal with the implementation later.</p>
<p>Also note that we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle">split the interfaces by features</a>. Everything payment-related is in one module, storage-related in another. This way it will be easier to ensure that the functionality of different third party services are not mixed up.</p>
<h3 id="payment-system-interface">Payment System Interface<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#payment-system-interface">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#payment-system-interface"></a></h3>
<p>The cookie store is a sample application, so the payment system will be very simple. It will have a <code>tryPay</code> method, which will accept the amount of money that needs to be paid, and in response will send a confirmation that everything is OK.</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// application/ports.ts</span>

<span class="token keyword module">export</span> <span class="token keyword">interface</span> <span class="token class-name"><span class="token maybe-class-name">PaymentService</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We won't handle errors, because error handling is a topic for a whole separate big post 😃</p>
<p>Yes, usually the payment is done on the server, but this is a sample-example, let's do everything on the client. We could easily communicate with our API instead of directly with the payment system. This change, by the way, would only affect this use case, the rest of the code would remain untouched.</p>

<p>If something goes wrong, we have to tell the user about it.</p>
<p>The user can be notified in different ways. We can use the UI, we can send letters, we can user's phone to vibrate (please, don't).</p>
<p>In general, the notification service would also be better to be abstract, so that now we don't have to think about the implementation.</p>
<p>Let it take a message and <em>somehow</em> notify the user:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// application/ports.ts</span>

<p>We will save the new order in a local repository.</p>
<p>This storage can be anything: Redux, MobX, whatever-floats-your-boat-js. The repository can be divided into micro-stores for different entities or be one big repository for all the application data. It's not important right now either, because these are implementation details.</p>
<p>I like to divide the storage interfaces into separate ones for each entity. A separate interface for the user data store, a separate one for the shopping cart, a separate one for the order store:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// application/ports.ts</span>

<span class="token keyword module">export</span> <span class="token keyword">interface</span> <span class="token class-name"><span class="token maybe-class-name">OrdersStorageService</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  orders<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Order</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token function">updateOrders</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>orders<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Order</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token keyword">void</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In the example here I make only the order store interface, all the rest you can see in <a href="https://github.com/bespoyasov/frontend-clean-architecture/blob/master/src/application/ports.ts#L5">source code</a>.</p>
<h3 id="use-case-function">Use Case Function<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#use-case-function">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#use-case-function"></a></h3>
<p>Let's see if we can build the use case using the created interfaces and the existing domain functionality. As we described earlier, the script will consist of the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>verify the data;</li>
<li>create an order;</li>
<li>pay for the order;</li>
<li>notify about problems;</li>
<li>save the result.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/content/clean-architecture-on-frontend/flow.png" alt="All steps of the custom script in the diagram"></p>
<p>All steps of the custom script in the diagram</p>
<p>First, let's declare the stubs of the services we're going to use. TypeScript will swear that we haven't implemented the interfaces in the appropriate variables, but for now it doesn't matter.</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// application/orderProducts.ts</span>

<span class="token keyword">const</span> payment<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">PaymentService</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> notifier<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">NotificationService</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> orderStorage<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">OrdersStorageService</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We can now use these stubs as if they were real services. We can access their fields, call their methods. This comes in handy when “translating” a use case from the business language to software language.</p>
<p>Now, create a function called <code>orderProducts</code>. Inside, the first thing we do is create a new order:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// application/orderProducts.ts</span>
<span class="token comment">//...</span>

<span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">orderProducts</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>user<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">User</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> cart<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Cart</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword">const</span> order <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">createOrder</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>user<span class="token punctuation">,</span> cart<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Here we take advantage of the fact that the interface is a contract for behavior. This means that in the future the stubs will actually perform the actions we now expect:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// application/orderProducts.ts</span>
<span class="token comment">//...</span>

<span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">orderProducts</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>user<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">User</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> cart<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Cart</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

  <span class="token comment">// Save the result and clear the cart:</span>
  <span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> orders <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> orderStorage<span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the use case does not call third-party services directly. It relies on the behavior described in the interfaces, so as long as the interface remains the same, we don't care which module implements it and how. This makes the modules replaceable.</p>

<p>We have “translated” the use case into TypeScript. Now we have to check if the reality matches our needs.</p>
<p>Usually it doesn't. So we tweak the outside world to suit our needs with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern">adapters</a>.</p>

<p>The first adapter is a UI framework. It connects the native browser API with the application. In the case of the order creation, it is the “Checkout” button and the click handler, which will launch the use case function.</p>

<p>Let's provide the use case through a hook. We'll get all the services inside, and as a result, we'll return the use case function itself from the hook.</p>

<p>We use hooks as a “crooked dependency injection”. First we use the hooks <code>useNotifier</code>, <code>usePayment</code>, <code>useOrdersStorage</code> to get the service instances, and then we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)">closure</a> of the <code>useOrderProducts</code> function to make them available inside the <code>orderProducts</code> function.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the use case function is still separated from the rest of the code, which is important for testing. We'll pull it out completely and make it even more testable at the end of the article, when we do the review and refactoring.</p>

<p>For payment, we will use the fake API stub. Again, we are not forced to write the whole service now, we can write it later, the main thing—to implement the specified behavior:</p>

<p>We will write a hook for for each feature. This way we won't break <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle">ISP</a>, and the stores, at least in terms of interfaces, they will be atomic.</p>

<p>Also, this approach will give us the ability to customize additional optimizations for each store: we can create selectors, memoization, and more.</p>

<p>Let's now validate how the user will communicate with the application during the created use case.</p>
<p><img src="/images/content/clean-architecture-on-frontend/final.png" alt="Use case data flow diagram"></p>
<p>Use case data flow diagram</p>
<p>The user interacts with the UI layer, which can only access the application through ports. That is, we can change the UI if we want to.</p>
<p>Use cases are handled in the application layer, which tells us exactly what external services are required. All the main logic and data is in the domain.</p>
<p>All external services are hidden in the infrastructure and are subject to our specifications. If we need to change the service of sending messages, the only thing we will have to fix in the code is an adapter for the new service.</p>
<p>This scheme makes the code replaceable, testable and extensible to changing requirements.</p>

<p>All in all, this is enough to get you started and gain an initial understanding of the clean architecture. But I want to point out things that I have simplified to make the example easier.</p>
<p>This section is optional, but it will give an expanded understanding of what clean architecture “with no cut corners” might look like.</p>
<p>I would highlight a few things that can be done.</p>
<h3 id="use-object-instead-of-number-for-the-price">Use Object Instead of Number For the Price<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#use-object-instead-of-number-for-the-price">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#use-object-instead-of-number-for-the-price"></a></h3>
<p>You may have noticed that I use a number to describe the price. This is not a good practice.</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// shared-kernel.d.ts</span>

<span class="token keyword">type</span> <span class="token class-name"><span class="token maybe-class-name">PriceCents</span></span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">number</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>A number only indicates the quantity but not the currency, and a price without currency is meaningless. Ideally, price should be made as an object with two fields: value and currency.</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token keyword">type</span> <span class="token class-name"><span class="token maybe-class-name">Currency</span></span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"RUB"</span> <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token string">"USD"</span> <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token string">"EUR"</span> <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token string">"SEK"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">type</span> <span class="token class-name"><span class="token maybe-class-name">AmountCents</span></span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">number</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token keyword">type</span> <span class="token class-name"><span class="token maybe-class-name">Price</span></span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  value<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">AmountCents</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  currency<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Currency</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This will solve the problem of storing currencies and save a lot of effort and nerves when changing or adding currencies to the store. I didn't use this type in the examples so as not to complicate it. In the real code, however, the price would be more similar to this type.</p>
<p>Separately, it's worth mentioning the value of the price. I always keep the amount of money in the smallest fraction of the currency in circulation. For example, for the dollar it is cents.</p>
<p>Displaying the price in this way allows me not to think about division and fractional values. With money this is especially important if we want to avoid <a href="https://0.30000000000000004.com/">problems with floating point math</a>.</p>

<p>The code can be split in folders not “by layers” but “by features”. One feature would be a piece of the pie from the schematic below.</p>
<p>This structure is even more preferable, because it allows you to deploy certain features separately, which is often useful.</p>

<p>Component is a piece of a hex pie</p>
<p>I recommend reading about it in <a href="https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/#components">"DDD, Hexagonal, Onion, Clean, CQRS, ... How I put it all together"</a>.</p>
<p>I also suggest to look at <a href="https://feature-sliced.design/">Feature Sliced</a>, which is conceptually very similar to component code division, but easier to understand.</p>

<p>If we're talking about splitting system into components, it's worth mentioning the cross-component use of code as well. Let's remember the order creation function:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token keyword module">import</span> <span class="token imports"><span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Product</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> totalPrice <span class="token punctuation">}</span></span> <span class="token keyword module">from</span> <span class="token string">"./product"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

  <span class="token keyword control-flow">return</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    cart<span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    user<span class="token operator">:</span> user<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">id</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    status<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"new"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    created<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name"><span class="token known-class-name class-name">Date</span></span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">toISOString</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    total<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token function">totalPrice</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>products<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This function uses <code>totalPrice</code> from another component—the product. Such usage is fine by itself, but if we want to divide the code into independent features, we can't directly access the functionality of the other feature.</p>
<p>You can also see a way around this restriction in <a href="https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/#components">"DDD, Hexagonal, Onion, Clean, CQRS, ...

<p>For the shared kernel I used type-aliases. They are easy to operate with: you just have to create a new type and reference e.g. a string. But their disadvantage is that TypeScript has no mechanism to monitor their use and enforce it.</p>
<p>This doesn't seem to be a problem: so someone uses <code>string</code> instead of <code>DateTimeString</code>—so what? The code will compile.</p>
<p>The problem is exactly that the code will compile even though a broader type is used (in clever words <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">precondition is weakened</a>). This first of all makes the code more fragile because it allows you to use <em>any strings</em>, not just strings of <em>special quality</em>, which can lead to errors.</p>
<p>Secondly it's confusing to read, because it creates two sources of truth. It's unclear if you really only need to use the date there, or if you can basically use any string.</p>
<p>There is a way to make TypeScript understand that we want a particular type—use <a href="https://github.com/kourge/ts-brand">branding</a>, branded types. Branding <a href="https://medium.com/@KevinBGreene/surviving-the-typescript-ecosystem-branding-and-type-tagging-6cf6e516523d">enables</a> to keep track of exactly how types are used, but makes the code a little more complicated.</p>

<p>The next thing that stings is the creation of a date in the domain in the <code>createOrder</code> function:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token keyword module">import</span> <span class="token imports"><span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Product</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> totalPrice <span class="token punctuation">}</span></span> <span class="token keyword module">from</span> <span class="token string">"./product"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

    <span class="token comment">// This line:</span>

  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We can suspect that <code>new Date().toISOString()</code> will be repeated quite often in the project and would like to put it in some kind of a helper:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// lib/datetime.ts</span>

<span class="token keyword module">export</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">currentDatetime</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">DateTimeString</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>...And then use it in the domain:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// domain/order.ts</span>

<span class="token keyword module">import</span> <span class="token imports"><span class="token punctuation">{</span> currentDatetime <span class="token punctuation">}</span></span> <span class="token keyword module">from</span> <span class="token string">"../lib/datetime"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token keyword module">export</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">createOrder</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>user<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">User</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> cart<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Cart</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Order</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword control-flow">return</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>But we immediately remember that we can't depend on anything in the domain—so what should we do? It's a good idea that <code>createOrder</code> should take all the data for the order in a complete form. The date can be passed as the last argument:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// domain/order.ts</span>

<span class="token keyword module">export</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">createOrder</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>
  user<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">User</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  cart<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Cart</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  created<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">DateTimeString</span>
<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Order</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword control-flow">return</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    user<span class="token operator">:</span> user<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">id</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    products<span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    created<span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    status<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"new"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    total<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token function">totalPrice</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>products<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This also allows us not to break the dependency rule in cases where creating a date <em>depends on libraries</em>. If we create a date outside a domain function, it is likely that the date will be created inside the use case and passed as an argument:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">someUserCase</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// Use the `dateTimeSource` adapter,</span>
  <span class="token comment">// to get the current date in the desired format:</span>
  <span class="token keyword">const</span> createdOn <span class="token operator">=</span> dateTimeSource<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">currentDatetime</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

  <span class="token comment">// Pass already created date to the domain function:</span>
  <span class="token function">createOrder</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>user<span class="token punctuation">,</span> cart<span class="token punctuation">,</span> createdOn<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This will keep the domain independent and also make it easier to test.</p>
<p>In the examples I chose not to focus on this for two reasons: it would distract from the main point, and I see nothing wrong with depending on your own helper if it uses <em>only</em> language features. Such helpers can even be considered as the shared kernel, because they only reduce code duplication.</p>

<p>What was really not good about creating a date inside the <code>createOrder</code> function was the side-effect. The problem with side-effects is that they make the system less predictable than you'd like it to be. What helps to cope with this are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure</a> data transformations in the domain, that is, ones that don't produce side-effects.</p>
<p>Creating a date is a side-effect, because the result of calling <code>Date.now()</code> is different at different times. A pure function, on the other hand, with the same arguments <strong>always</strong> returns the same result.</p>
<p>I've come to the conclusion that it's better to keep the domain as clean as possible. It's easier to test, easier to port and update, and easier to read. Side-effects drastically increase the cognitive load when debugging, and the domain is not the place to keep complicated and confusing code at all.</p>

<p>In this little example, <code>Order</code> includes the <code>Cart</code>, because the cart only represents a list of products:</p>

  total<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">PriceCents</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This may not work if there are additional properties in the <code>Cart</code> that have nothing to do with the <code>Order</code>. In such cases, it is better to use data projections or intermediate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">DTO</a>.</p>
<p>As an option, we could use the “Product List” entity:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token keyword">type</span> <span class="token class-name"><span class="token maybe-class-name">ProductList</span></span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Product</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<p>The use case has a lot to discuss as well. Right now, the <code>orderProducts</code> function is hard to test in isolation from React—that's bad. Ideally, it should be possible to test it with minimal effort.</p>
<p>The problem with the current implementation is the hook that provides use case access to the UI:</p>

<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In a canonical implementation, the use case function would be located outside the hook, and the services would be passed to the use case via the last argument or via a DI:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token keyword">type</span> <span class="token class-name"><span class="token maybe-class-name">Dependencies</span></span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

<span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">orderProducts</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>

  <span class="token comment">// ...</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The hook would then become an adapter:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">useOrderProducts</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

  <span class="token keyword">const</span> orderStorage <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">useOrdersStorage</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

  <span class="token keyword control-flow">return</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>user<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">User</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> cart<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Cart</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token arrow operator">=></span>
    <span class="token function">orderProducts</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>user<span class="token punctuation">,</span> cart<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      notifier<span class="token punctuation">,</span>

      orderStorage<span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Then the hook code could be considered an adapter, and only the use case would remain in the application layer. The <code>orderProducts</code> function could be tested by passing the required service mochas as dependencies.</p>

<p>There, in the application layer, we now inject services by hand:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token keyword module">export</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">useOrderProducts</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// Here we use hooks to get the instances of each service,</span>
  <span class="token comment">// which will be used inside the orderProducts use case:</span>
  <span class="token keyword">const</span> notifier <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">useNotifier</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

    <span class="token comment">// ...Inside the use case we use those services.</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">}</span>

  <span class="token keyword control-flow">return</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> orderProducts <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>But in general, this can be automated and done with <a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/di-ts-in-practice/">dependency injection</a>. We already looked at the simplest version of injection through the last argument, but you can go further and configure automatic injection.</p>
<p>In this particular application, I didn't think it made much sense to set up a DI. It would distract from the point and overcomplicate the code. And in the case of React and hooks, we can use them as a “container” that returns an implementation of the specified interface. Yes, it's manual work, but it doesn't increase the entry threshold and is quicker to read for new developers.</p>

<p>The example in the post is refined and intentionally simple. It is clear that life is much more surprising and complicated than this example. So I also want to talk about common problems that can arise when working with the clean architecture.</p>

<p>The most important problem is the subject area that we lack knowledge about. Imagine a store has a product, a discounted product, and a write-off product. How do we properly describe these entities?</p>
<p>Should there be a “base” entity that will be expanded? How exactly should this entity be expanded? Should there be additional fields? Should these entities be mutually exclusive? How should user cases behave if there's another entity instead of a simple one? Should the duplication be reduced immediately?</p>
<p>There may be too many questions and too many answers, because neither the team nor the stakeholders know yet how the system should actually behave. If there are only assumptions, you can find yourself in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">analysis paralysis</a>.</p>
<p>Specific solutions depend on the specific situation, I can only recommend a few general things.</p>
<p><strong>Don't use inheritance</strong>, even if it's called “extension”. Even if it looks like the interface is really inherited. Even if it looks like “well, there's clearly a hierarchy here”. Just wait.</p>
<p>Copypaste in code is not always evil, <a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/copy-paste/">it's a tool</a>. Make two almost identical entities, see how they behave in reality, observe them. At some point you'll notice that they've either become very different, or they really only differ in one field. It's easier to merge two similar entities into one than it is to create checks for every possible condition and variant.</p>
<p>If you still have to extend something...</p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)">covariance, contravariance, and invariance</a></strong> so you don't accidentally come up with more work than you should.</p>
<p><strong>Use the analogy with <a href="https://en.bem.info/">blocks and modifiers from BEM</a></strong> when choosing between different entities and extensions. It helps me a lot to determine if I have a separate entity or a “modifier-extension” the code, if I think of it in the context of BEM.</p>

<p>The second big problem is related use cases, where an event from one use case triggers another.</p>
<p>The only way to handle this, which I know and which helps me, is to break up the use cases into smaller, atomic use cases. They will be easier to put together.</p>
<p>In general, the problem with such scripts, is a consequence of another big problem in programming, entities composition.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">a lot</a> already written about how to efficiently compose entities, and there's even a whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">mathematics section</a>. We won't go far there, that's a topic for a separate post.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions<a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#conclusions">#</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusions"></a></h2>
<p>In this post, I've outlined and expanded a bit on my talk on the clean architecture on the frontend.</p>
<p>It's not a gold standard, but rather a compilation of experience with different projects, paradigms, and languages. I find it a convenient scheme that allows you to decouple code and make independent layers, modules, services, which not only can be deployed and published separately, but also transferred from project to project if needed.</p>
<p>We haven't touched on OOP because architecture and OOP are orthogonal. Yes, architecture talks about entity composition, but it doesn't dictate what should be the unit of composition: object or function. You can work with this in different paradigms, as we've seen in the examples.</p>
<p>As for OOP, I recently wrote a post about <a href="https://bespoyasov.me/blog/generating-trees-on-canvas-using-typescript-and-oop/">how to use the clean architecture with OOP</a>. In this post, we write a tree picture generator on canvas.</p>
<p>To see how exactly you can combine this approach with other stuff like chip slicing, hexagonal architecture, CQS and other stuff, I recommend reading <a href="https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/">DDD, Hexagonal, Onion, Clean, CQRS, ... How I put it all together</a> and the whole series of articles from this blog. Very insightful, concise, and to the point.</p>

very long ago I gave a talk about the clean architecture on frontend. In this post, I'm summarizing that talk and expanding it a bit with details and concepts I didn't have time to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI'll put links here to all sorts of useful stuff that will come in handy as you read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/ThgqBecaq_w\"\u003eThe Public Talk\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bespoyasov.ru/talks/podlodka-conf-clean-architecture/en.html\"\u003eSlides for the Talk\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bespoyasov/frontend-clean-architecture\"\u003eThe source code for the application we're going to design\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bespoyasov.me/showcase/frontend-clean-architecture/\"\u003eSample of a working application\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"whats-the-plan\"\u003eWhat's the Plan\u003ca href=\"https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#whats-the-plan\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#whats-the-plan\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, we'll talk about what the clean architecture is in general and get familiar with such concepts as domain, use case and application layers. Then we'll discuss how this applies to the frontend and whether it's worth it at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, we'll design the frontend for a cookie store following the rules of the clean architecture. And finally, we'll implement one of the use cases from scratch to see if it's usable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe store will use React as its UI framework just to show that this approach can be used with it as well. (And because the talk this post is based on was addressed to developers who already use React 😄) Although React is not necessary, you can use everything I show in this post with other UI libs or frameworks too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere will be a little TypeScript in the code, but only to show how to use types and interfaces to describe entities. Everything we'll look at today can be used without TypeScript, except the code won't be as expressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will hardly talk about OOP today, so this post should not cause any severe allergies. We will only mention OOP once at the end, but it won't stop us from designing an application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, we'll skip tests today because they are not the main topic of this post. I will keep in mind testability though and mention how to improve it along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally, this post is mostly about you grasping the concept of clean architecture. The examples in the post are simplified, so it isn't literal instruction on how to write the code. Understand the idea and think about how you can apply these principles in your projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the post, you can find a list of methodologies that are related to clean architecture and used on the frontend more widely. So you can find a best fit depending on the size of your project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, let's dig in!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"architecture-and-design\"\u003eArchitecture and Design\u003ca href=\"https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#architecture-and-design\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#architecture-and-design\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesigning is fundamentally about taking things apart... in such a way that they can be put back together. ...Separating things into things that can be composed that's what design is.\u003cbr\u003e\n— Rich Hickey. \u003ca href=\"https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Design-Composition-Performance/\"\u003eDesign Composition and Performance\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSystem design, says the quote in the epigraph, is the system separation so that it can be reassembled later. And most importantly, be assembled \u003cem\u003eeasily, without too much work\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agree. But I consider another goal of an architecture to be the extensibility of the system. The demands on the program are constantly changing. We want the program to be easy to update and modify to meet new requirements. The clean architecture can help achieve this goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-clean-architecture\"\u003eThe Clean Architecture\u003ca href=\"https://bespoyasov.me/blog/clean-architecture-on-frontend/#the-clean-architecture\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-clean-architecture\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html\"\u003eThe clean architecture\u003c/a\u003e is a way of separating responsibilities and parts of functionality according to their proximity to the application domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_knowledge\"\u003ethe domain\u003c/a\u003e, we mean the part of the real world that we model with a program.

We use TypeScript, we use its standard type library, but we don't consider them as \u003cem\u003edependencies\u003c/em\u003e. This is because the modules that use them may not know anything about each other and remain decoupled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot all code can be classified as shared kernel.

Should there be additional fields? Should these entities be mutually exclusive? How should user cases behave if there's another entity instead of a simple one? Should the duplication be reduced immediately?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere may be too many questions and too many answers, because neither the team nor the stakeholders know yet how the system should actually behave. If there are only assumptions, you can find yourself in an \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis\"\u003eanalysis paralysis\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecific solutions depend on the specific situation, I can only recommend a few general things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon't use inheritance\u003c/strong\u003e, even if it's called “extension”.

Make two almost identical entities, see how they behave in reality, observe them. At some point you'll notice that they've either become very different, or they really only differ in one field. It's easier to merge two similar entities into one than it is to create checks for every possible condition and variant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you still have to extend something...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeep in mind \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)\"\u003ecovariance, contravariance, and invariance\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e so you don't accidentally come up with more work than you should.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUse the analogy with \u003ca href=\"https://en.bem.info/\"\u003eblocks and modifiers from BEM\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e when choosing between different entities and extensions.

I find it a convenient scheme that allows you to decouple code and make independent layers, modules, services, which not only can be deployed and published separately, but also transferred from project to project if needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe haven't touched on OOP because architecture and OOP are orthogonal. Yes, architecture talks about entity composition, but it doesn't dictate what should be the unit of composition: object or function. You can work with this in different paradigms, as we've seen in the examples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for OOP, I recently wrote a post about \u003ca href=\"https://bespoyasov.me/blog/generating-trees-on-canvas-using-typescript-and-oop/\"\u003ehow to use the clean architecture with OOP\u003c/a\u003e. In this post, we write a tree picture generator on canvas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo see how exactly you can combine this approach with other stuff like chip slicing, hexagonal architecture, CQS and other stuff, I recommend reading \u003ca href=\"https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/\"\u003eDDD, Hexagonal, Onion, Clean, CQRS, ...
