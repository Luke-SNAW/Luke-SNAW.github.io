<p>I’ve led infrastructure at a <a href="https://cresta.com/careers/">startup</a> for the past 4 years that has had to scale quickly. From the beginning I made some core decisions that the company has had to stick to, for better or worse, these past four years. This post will list some of the major decisions made and if I endorse them for your startup, or if I regret them and advise you to pick something else.</p>

<p>Early on, we were using both GCP and AWS. During that time, I had no idea who my “account manager” was for Google Cloud, while at the same time I had regular cadence meetings with our AWS account manager. There is a feel that Google lives on robots and automation, while Amazon lives with a customer focus. This support has helped us when evaluating new AWS services. Besides support, AWS has done a great job around stability and minimizing backwards incompatible API changes.</p>
<p>There was a time when Google Cloud was the choice for Kubernetes clusters, especially when there was ambiguity around if AWS would invest in EKS over <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">ECS</a>. Now though, with all the extra Kubernetes integrations around AWS services (external-dns, external-secrets, etc), this is not much of any issue anymore.</p>
<h3 id="eks-link-to-heading"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">EKS</a> <a href="https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#ekshttpsawsamazoncomeks">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#eks-link-to-heading"></a></h3>
<p>🟩 <em>Endorse</em></p>
<p>Unless you’re penny-pinching (and your time is free), there’s no reason to run your own control plane rather than use EKS. The main advantage of using an alternative in AWS, like ECS, is the deep integration into AWS services. Luckily, Kubernetes has caught up in many ways: for example, using external-dns to integrate with Route53.</p>

<p>🟧 <em>Regret</em></p>
<p>We started with EKS managed addons because I thought it was the “right” way to use EKS. Unfortunately, we always ran into a situation where we needed to customize the installation itself. Maybe the CPU requests, the image tag, or some configmap. We’ve since switched to using helm charts for what were add-ons and things are running much better with promotions that fit similar to our existing GitOps pipelines.</p>
<h3 id="rds-link-to-heading"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">RDS</a> <a href="https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#rdshttpsawsamazoncomrds">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#rds-link-to-heading"></a></h3>

<p>Redis has worked very well as a cache and general use product. It’s fast, the API is simple and well documented, and the implementation is battle tested. Unlike other cache options, like Memcached, Redis has a lot of features that make it useful for more than just caching. It’s a great swiss army knife of “do fast data thing”.</p>
<p>Part of me is unsure what the state of Redis is for Cloud Providers, but I feel it’s so widely used by AWS customers that AWS will continue to support it well.</p>

<p>We originally hosted on <a href="https://quay.io/">quay.io</a>. It was a hot mess of stability problems. Since moving to ECR, things have been much more stable. The deeper permission integrations with EKS nodes or dev servers has also been a big plus.</p>

<p>Before integrating AFT, using control tower was a pain mostly because it was very difficult to automate. We’ve since integrated AFT into our stack and spinning up accounts has worked well since. Another thing AFT makes easier is standardizing tags for our accounts. For example, our production accounts have a tag that we can then use to make peering decisions. Tags work better than organizations for us because the decision of “what properties describe this account” isn’t always a tree structure.</p>

<p>Everyone is busy. It can feel like you’re the “bad guy” reminding people to fill out the post-mortem. Making a robot be the bad guy had been great. It streamlines the process by nudging people to follow the SEV and post-mortem procedure.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be too complex to start. Just the basics of “It’s been an hour of no messages. Someone post an update” or “It’s been a day with no calendar invite. Someone schedule the post-mortem meeting” can go a long ways.</p>

<p>Alerting for a company goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are no alerts at all. We need alerts.</li>
<li>We have alerts. There are too many alerts, so we ignore them.</li>
<li>We’ve prioritized the alerts. Now only the critical ones wake me up.</li>
<li>We ignore the non-critical alerts.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have a two tiered alerting setup: critical and non-critical. Critical alerts wake people up. Non-critical alerts are expected to ping the on-call async (email). The problem is that non-critical alerts are often ignored. To resolve this, we have regular (usually every 2 weeks) PagerDuty review meetings where we go over all our alerts. For the critical alerts, we discuss if it should stay critical. Then, we iterate the non-critical alerts (usually picking a few each meeting) and discuss what we can do to clear those out as well (usually tweaking the threshold or creating some automation).</p>

<p>🟩 <em>Endorse</em></p>
<p>Early on, I set up a monthly meeting to go over all of our SaaS cost (AWS, DataDog, etc). Previously, this was just something reviewed from a finance perspective, but it’s hard for them to answer general questions around “does this cost number seem right”. During these meetings, usually attended by both finance and engineering, we go over every software related bill we get and do a gut check of “does this cost sound right”. We dive into the numbers of each of the high bills and try to break them down.</p>
<p>For example, with AWS we group items by tag and separate them by account. These two dimensions, combined with the general service name (EC2, RDS, etc) gives us a good idea of where the major cost drivers are. Some things we do with this data are go deeper into spot instance usage or which accounts contribute to networking costs the most. But don’t stop at just AWS: go into all the major spend sinks your company has.</p>

<p>🟥 <em>Regret</em></p>
<p>Everyone should do post-mortems. Both <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/product/incident-management/">DataDog</a> and PagerDuty have integrations to manage writing post-mortems and we tried each. Unfortunately, they both make it hard to customize the post-mortem process. Given how powerful wiki-ish tools like Notion are, I think it’s better to use a tool like that to manage post-mortems.</p>

<p>🟥 <em>Regret</em></p>
<p>There are no great FaaS options for running GPU workloads, which is why we could never go fully FaaS. However, many CPU workloads could be FaaS (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">lambda</a>, etc). The biggest counter-point people bring up is the cost. They’ll say something like “This EC2 instance type running 24/7 at full load is way less expensive than a Lambda running”. This is true, but it’s also a false comparison. Nobody runs a service at 100% CPU utilization and moves on with their life. It’s always on some scaler that says “Never reach 100%. At 70% scale up another”. And it’s always unclear when to scale back down, instead it’s a heuristic of “If we’ve been at 10% for 10 minutes, scale down”. Then, people assume spot instances when they aren’t always on market.</p>
<p>Another hidden benefit of Lambda is that it’s very easy to track costs with high accuracy. When deploying services in Kubernetes, cost can get hidden behind other per node objects or other services running on the same node.</p>

<p>🟩 <em>Endorse</em></p>
<p>GitOps has so far scaled pretty well and we use it for many parts of our infrastructure: services, terraform, and config to name a few. The main downside is that pipeline oriented workflows give a clear picture of “here is the box that means you did a commit and here are arrows that go from that box to the end of the pipeline”. With GitOps we’ve had to invest in tooling to help people answer questions like “I did a commit: why isn’t it deployed yet”.</p>
<p>Even still, the flexibility of GitOps has been a huge win and I strongly recommend it for your company.</p>

<p>Most likely, your company is not selling the infrastructure itself, but another product. This puts pressure on the team to deliver features and not scale your own workload.

<p>🟥 <em>Regret</em></p>
<p>Like most tech debt, we didn’t <em>make</em> this decision, we just did not <em>not</em> make this decision. Eventually, someone wants the product to do a new thing and makes a new table. This feels good because there are now foreign keys between the two tables. But since <em>everything</em> is owned by <em>someone</em> and that <em>someone</em> is a row in a table, you’ve got foreign keys between all objects in the entire stack.</p>
<p>Since the database is used by <em>everyone</em>, it becomes cared for by <em>no one</em>. Startups don’t have the luxury of a DBA, and everything owned by <em>no one</em> is owned by <em>infrastructure</em> eventually.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with a shared database are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crud accumulates in the database, and it’s unclear if it can be deleted.</li>
<li>When there are performance issues, infrastructure (without deep product knowledge) has to debug the database and figure out who to redirect to</li>
<li>Database users can push bad code that does bad things to the database. These bad things may PagerDuty alert the infrastructure team (since they own the database). It feels bad to wake up one team for another team’s issue. With application owned databases, the application team is the first responder.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that said, I’m not against stacks that want to share a single database either. Just be aware of the tradeoffs above and have a good story for how you’ll manage them.</p>

It’s worked very well, has integrations for almost everything, and solves a lot of compliance/security aspects.

<p>🟧 <em>Endorse-ish</em></p>
<p>We, like most companies, host our code on GitHub. While originally using CircleCI, we’ve switched to Github actions for CI/CD. The marketplace of actions available to use for your workflows is large and the syntax is easy to read. The main downside of Github actions is their support for self-hosted workflows is very limited. We’re using EKS and <a href="https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller">actions-runner-controller</a> for our self-hosted runners hosted in EKS, but the integration is often buggy (but nothing we cannot work around). I hope GitHub takes Kuberentes self-hosting more seriously in the future.</p>

<p>🟥 <em>Regret</em></p>
<p>Datadog is a great product, but it’s expensive. More than just expensive, I’m worried their cost model is especially bad for Kubernetes clusters and for AI companies. Kubernetes clusters are most cost-effective when you can rapidly spin up and down many nodes, as well as use spot instances. Datadog’s pricing model is based on the number of instances you have and that means even if we have no more than 10 instances up at once, if we spin up and down 20 instances in that hour, we pay for 20 instances. Similarly, AI companies tend to use GPUs heavily. While a CPU node could have dozens of services running at once, spreading the per node Datadog cost between many use cases, a GPU node is likely to have only one service using it, making the per <strong>service</strong> Datadog cost much higher.</p>

<p>We frequently need to automate some process for an internal engineer: restart/promote/diagnose/etc. It’s easy enough for us to make APIs to solve these problems, but it’s a bit annoying debugging someone’s specific installation of a CLI/os/dependencies/etc. Being able to make a simple UI for engineers to interact with our scripts is very useful.</p>
<p>We self-host our AppSmith. It works … well enough. Of course there are things we would change, but it is enough for the “free” price point.

<p>While Terraform and CloudFormation are data files (HCL and YAML/JSON) that describe your infrastructure, solutions like Pulumi or CDK allow you to write code that does the same. Code is of course powerful, but I’ve found the restrictive nature of Terraform’s HCL to be a benefit with reduced complexity. It’s not that it’s impossible to write complex Terraform: it’s just that it’s more obvious when it’s happening.</p>
<p>Some of these solutions, like Pulumi, were invented many years ago while Terraform lacked a lot of the features it has today. Newer versions of Terraform have integrated a lot of the features that we can use to reduce complexity.

Nobody runs a service at 100% CPU utilization and moves on with their life. It’s always on some scaler that says “Never reach 100%. At 70% scale up another”.

Datadog’s pricing model is based on the number of instances you have and that means even if we have no more than 10 instances up at once, if we spin up and down 20 instances in that hour, we pay for 20 instances. Similarly, AI companies tend to use GPUs heavily. While a CPU node could have dozens of services running at once, spreading the per node Datadog cost between many use cases, a GPU node is likely to have only one service using it, making the per \u003cstrong\u003eservice\u003c/strong\u003e Datadog cost much higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"pagerduty-link-to-heading\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.pagerduty.com/\"\u003ePagerduty\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#pagerdutyhttpswwwpagerdutycom\"\u003eLink to heading\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#pagerduty-link-to-heading\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e🟩 \u003cem\u003eEndorse\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePagerduty is a great product and well priced.
