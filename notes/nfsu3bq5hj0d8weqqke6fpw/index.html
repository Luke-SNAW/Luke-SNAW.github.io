<p>I know some great programmers who don’t program outside of work at all! So I got to thinking – what if you want to become awesome, but don’t want to spend a lot of time basically doing extra work after hours?</p>
<p>Here are some things me &#x26; people on twitter came up with. Everything in here is stuff I can do during my workday.</p>
<h2 id="dont-learn-programming-languagesframeworks-outside-of-work">Don’t learn programming languages/frameworks outside of work<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dont-learn-programming-languagesframeworks-outside-of-work"></a></h2>
<p>... That is interesting and I’m happy to be doing it. But it is not so fun that I feel like spending a lot of my personal time on it. And I don’t really think it’s necessary, I learn languages by writing them, reading other people’s code to learn about conventions, and having my code reviewed. I can just do all of those things at work!</p>
<p>To be clear, I don’t think it’s bad to learn programming languages outside of work. I just don’t really do it.</p>
<h2 id="choose-projects-i-think-ill-learn-from">Choose projects I think I’ll learn from<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#choose-projects-i-think-ill-learn-from"></a></h2>
<p>I think it’s silly when people are like “hey, we work with X technologies, you need to have experience with them to work here”. Right now I spend a lot of time with networking/puppet/kubernetes/docker/AWS and I had never worked with any of those things before this job.</p>
<h2 id="watch-more-senior-people-operate">Watch more senior people operate<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#watch-more-senior-people-operate"></a></h2>
<p>When someone is doing work I really admire, I’ll watch how they do it and then try to emulate them / ask them for advice.</p>
<h2 id="read-every-pull-request">Read every pull request<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#read-every-pull-request"></a></h2>
<p>I don’t actually read every single pull request on my team. But I <strong>do</strong> find it useful to pick a few areas I want to keep learning about, and keep track over time of the work people are doing in that area.</p>
<h2 id="read-the-source-code">Read the source code<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#read-the-source-code"></a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading source of what I use is a big one for me. Understand what it does internally but mainly why it does it a certain way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a fantastic tip and super important!! A lot of systems aren’t really that well documented and you can’t learn how they work without reading their source code.</p>
<h2 id="follow-up-on-bugs-i-couldnt-figure-out">Follow up on bugs I couldn’t figure out<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#follow-up-on-bugs-i-couldnt-figure-out"></a></h2>
<h2 id="use-your-commute">Use your commute<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#use-your-commute"></a></h2>
<p>I don’t have a commute but a lot of people mentioned using their commute time to listen to podcasts / read papers / read interesting articles. I think this seems like an awesome way to keep up with things you’re interested in!</p>
