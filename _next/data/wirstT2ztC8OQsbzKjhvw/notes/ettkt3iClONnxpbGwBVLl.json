The constraints are what made it a hard problem, but the only reason they were able to hit this goal in an impossibly short timeline is the huge amount of resources that they put toward a very clear goal (which was, honestly, less \"let man explore the heavens\" than \"beat the Soviets\"). — <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44237540&#x26;how=un&#x26;auth=51df6f06022c423f1c5abe96dab72810e7a7f3c5&#x26;goto=item%3Fid%3D44232714#44237540\">#</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>결점을 알고도 일부러 썼다면 사기에 가까운 장시논리. 일부에게만 팔려도 이득이라는 betting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I agree with the author, but I would also say there is something above goals and constraints. Values. A set of things that, when comparing multiple options, make the choice clear. An example of some values I frequently use is \"What will give me the most enjoyment the furthest into the future? \"What will result in the world being a better place?\" \"What will make me become someone who resembles Jesus more?\" They are different from constraints as they don't knock out any options by default. Instead, they make triaging when there are many different things I could be doing much easier, and circumvent my messy intuition which is based on hormones, hunger, weather, etc.<br>\nI think values, goals, and constraints are all valuable, but it's a hierarchy. We should create constraints that help us become more aligned with our values. We should create shorter-term goals that make it easy to stay within our constraints. — <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44236709\">#</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://longform.asmartbear.com/rocks-pebbles-sand/\">Rocks, Pebbles, Sand: How to implement in practice</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Prioritize by impact, not just size: The Rocks, Pebbles, Sand framework emphasizes prioritizing tasks based on their strategic impact rather than just their size or urgency.</li>\n<li>Use a simple sprint-planning system: Prioritize tasks in this order: time-critical items, Rocks, Pebbles, and Sand.

Studiousness is the virtue of attention, of self-mastery in relation to intellectual pursuits, of prudent allocation of attention to what you should; curiosity is the vice of inattention, of spreading yourself too thin, to pursue things other than what one should or what is not worth pursuing, pursuing that which is beyond your reach, of flitting about between things, of inordinate desire in the domain of intellectual pursuits. The studious man attains wisdom, the curious man remains, at best, a coasting, superficial dilettante. The difference between the studious man and the curious man is something like the difference between the committed and faithful husband and the waffling philanderer. The former shows restraint in relation to his appetites and is able to build a relationship and raise a family, while the latter is a mess who never achieves anything of value, slavishly indulging his appetites that lead nowhere but his own misery and mediocrity. In all these cases, desirable things may present themselves that would derail you from your aim and sabotage your achievement and your own good. In all these cases, commitment involves refusing to indulge those desires because doing so is counterproductive and harmful in relation to the good pursued.</p>\n<p>In life, we must make decisions. The word \"decision\" comes from the Latin \"to cut off\", as in to cut off options or paths. The grapevine must be pruned to strengthen it and produce more fruit. Of course, we must decide wisely, there is no question about that, but FOMO is the opposite of that. It is an intemperate and immoderate desire for everything, never committing to anything and therefore never attaining anything and never becoming anything.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-you-deal-with-information-and-internet-addiction\"><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34711741\">How do you deal with information and internet addiction?</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#how-do-you-deal-with-information-and-internet-addiction\"></a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The purpose of knowledge is action, not knowledge.\n― Aristotle</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge isn't free.
