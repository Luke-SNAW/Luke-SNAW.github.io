As soon as the request is queued, the actual work of the request is handed off to a browser-level API behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>As it relates to performance, this is good — you don’t want requests hogging the main thread. But it also means there’s a risk of them being deserted when a page enters into that “terminated” state, leaving no guarantee that any of that behind-the-scenes work reaches completion. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/page-lifecycle-api#states\">Here’s how Google summarizes</a> that specific lifecycle state:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A page is in the terminated state once it has started being unloaded and cleared from memory by the browser. No <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#queue-a-task\">new tasks</a> can start in this state, and in-progress tasks may be killed if they run too long.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, the browser is designed with the assumption that when a page is dismissed, there’s no need to continue to process any background processes queued by it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"so-what-are-our-options\">So, what are our options?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#so-what-are-our-options\"></a></h1>\n<p>... to delay the user action until the request returns a response.<br>\nThat gets the job done, but there are some non-trivial drawbacks.</p>\n<p>First, it compromises the user’s experience by delaying the desired behavior from occurring.</p>\n<p>Second, this approach isn’t as reliable as it initially sounds, since some termination behaviors can’t be programmatically delayed.<br>\nFor example, e.preventDefault() is useless in delaying someone from closing a browser tab.</p>\n<h1 id=\"instructing-the-browser-to-preserve-outstanding-requests\">Instructing the browser to preserve outstanding requests<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#instructing-the-browser-to-preserve-outstanding-requests\"></a></h1>\n<h2 id=\"using-fetchs-keepalive-flag\">Using Fetch’s keepalive flag<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#using-fetchs-keepalive-flag\"></a></h2>\n<p>If the <a href=\"https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#request-keepalive-flag\">keepalive flag</a> is set to true when using fetch(), the corresponding request will remain open, even if the page that initiated that request is terminated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-navigatorsendbeacon\">Using <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/beacon/#sec-processing-model\">Navigator.sendBeacon()</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#using-navigatorsendbeacon\"></a></h2>\n<h2 id=\"an-honorable-mention-for-the-ping-attribute\">An honorable mention for <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/the-ping-attribute-on-anchor-links/\">the ping attribute</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#an-honorable-mention-for-the-ping-attribute\"></a></h2>\n<p>It’s technically similar to sending a beacon, but has a few notable limitations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s strictly limited for use on links, which makes it a non-starter if you need to track data associated with other interactions, like button clicks or form submissions.</li>\n<li>Browser support is good, <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/ping\">but not great</a>.</li>\n<li>You’re unable to send any custom data along with the request.
