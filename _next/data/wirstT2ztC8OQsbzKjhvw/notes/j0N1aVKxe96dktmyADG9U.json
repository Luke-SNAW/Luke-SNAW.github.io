When I wrote the code, I know it by heart and I know what it does (or is supposed to do). At least for me, having to be creating prompts and then reviewing the code that generates is slower and takes me out of the flow. It is also more exhausting than just writing the thing myself.</li>\n<li>I am only able to check the correctness of the code, if am am proficient enough as a programmer (and possibly in the language as well). To become proficient I need to write a lot of code, but the more I use LLMs, the less repetitions I get in. So in a way it feels like LLMs are going to make you a \"worse\" programmer by doing the work for you.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://floooh.github.io/2018/06/17/handles-vs-pointers.html\">Handles are the better pointers</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.evanjones.ca/nanosecond-collisions.html\">Nanosecond timestamp collisions are common</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format\">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://instagram-engineering.com/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of-technologies-adf2e22da2ad\">How Instagram scaled to 14 million users with only 3 engineers</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep things very simple.</li>\n<li>Don’t re-invent the wheel.</li>\n<li>Use proven, solid technologies when possible.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/\">Locality of Behaviour (LoB)</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://alexkondov.com/locality-of-behavior-react/\">Locality of Behavior in React Components</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstractions are not an enemy of locality.

However one of the unexpected consequences is that we are now doing a lot of network calls between these microservices, and this has actually become the main speed bottleneck for our program, especially since some of these services are not even in the same data center. We are now attempting to solve this with caches and doing batch requests, but all of this created additional overhead that could have all been avoided by not using microservices.<br>\nThis experience has strongly impacted my view of microservices and for all personal projects I will develop in the future I will stick with a monolith until much later instead of starting with microservices.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/source-and-buggy/do-one-thing-and-do-it-well-886b11a5d21\">Kernighan and Pike were right: Do one thing, and do it well</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fernandovillalba.substack.com/p/its-not-microservice-or-monolith\">It's not microservice or monolith; it's cognitive load you need to understand first</a>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>“Instead of choosing between a monolithic architecture or a microservices architecture, design the software to fit the maximum team cognitive load”</li>\n<li>If you have only one team, consider adjusting your architecture to match the team’s capacity.

While it promises better performance and ease of implementation, it may only achieve one, not both. A share-nothing approach keeps data in separate core caches but is complex to implement transactionally. Research showed this approach reduced tail latencies over a shared approach. However, the experiments did not test dynamic work imbalances that could appear in practice. Work-stealing may help address imbalances while still keeping some data pinned to cores, achieving both performance and utilization benefits. The debate focuses on balancing work-stealing with shared state rather than ease of implementation claims.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37791635\">The debate isn't about thread-per-core work stealing executors, it's whether async/await is a good abstraction for it in Rust.
