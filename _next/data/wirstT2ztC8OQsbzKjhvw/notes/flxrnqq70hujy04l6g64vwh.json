Don’t force a reviewer to read through 600 lines of code. Instead, provide a descriptive PR title and high-level summary at the top of the PR.</p>\n<p>This is why it's good practice to create and enforce the use of PR templates, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem</li>\n<li>Solution</li>\n<li>Impact</li>\n<li>Testing plan</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"keep-prs-short-same-with-files-and-functions\">Keep PRs short (same with files and functions)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#keep-prs-short-same-with-files-and-functions\"></a></h2>\n<h2 id=\"manage-pr-disagreements-through-direct-communication\">Manage PR disagreements through direct communication<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#manage-pr-disagreements-through-direct-communication\"></a></h2>\n<p>Why does direct communication help?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feedback will be faster.</li>\n<li>Verbal communication leads to fewer misunderstandings.</li>\n<li>10 minutes of verbal communication is a much more thorough review than a few back and forth GitHub comments.</li>\n<li>Direct conversation prevents constant context switching between other work and checking the PR comment section.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"avoid-rewrites-by-getting-feedback-early\">Avoid rewrites by getting feedback early<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#avoid-rewrites-by-getting-feedback-early\"></a></h2>\n<h2 id=\"request-additional-reviewers-to-create-dialogue\">Request additional reviewers to create dialogue<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#request-additional-reviewers-to-create-dialogue\"></a></h2>\n<p>Sometimes we want our code merged in quickly, so we seek an approval instead of a proper review and dialogue. However, shallow reviews defeat the purpose of code review.</p>\n<p>One step that can help open up a dialogue is to request more reviewers.</p>\n<p>Why does requesting more reviewers help?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It adds more perspectives. If only one approval is required, and only one review requested, other teammates will never get a chance to disagree.</li>\n<li>People are available at different times. Requesting more reviewers increases the likelihood that eyes get on the PR sooner.</li>\n<li>If there’s a more general coding style/design disagreement in the PR, others have a chance to weigh in or at least become aware of it.</li>\n<li>Standups are by nature more status updates than working in the weeds. When someone is requested on a PR, they can read exactly what a teammate is working on and can reference that code if they encounter a similar issue.</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","title":"Luke","desc":"","updated":1766965759366,"created":1644449449778,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"a724de3efd251cf89fe82a5860d9008b","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"life-tips","position":{"start":{"line":43,"column":5,"offset":2710},"end":{"line":43,"column":29,"offset":2734},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"life-tips","anchorHeader":"wodenokoto"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2026.articles","alias":"What I read in 2026","position":{"start":{"line":72,"column":3,"offset":4440},"end":{"line":72,"column":45,"offset":4482},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2026.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2025.articles","alias":"2025","position":{"start":{"line":73,"column":5,"offset":4487},"end":{"line":73,"column":32,"offset":4514},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2025.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2024.articles","alias":"2024","position":{"start":{"line":74,"column":5,"offset":4519},"end":{"line":74,"column":32,"offset":4546},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2024.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2023.articles","alias":"2023","position":{"start":{"line":75,"column":5,"offset":4551},"end":{"line":75,"column":32,"offset":4578},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2023.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2022.articles","alias":"2022","position":{"start":{"line":76,"column":5,"offset":4583},"end":{"line":76,"column":32,"offset":4610},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2022.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-struggled-brag-in","position":{"start":{"line":82,"column":3,"offset":4746},"end":{"line":82,"column":39,"offset":4782},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-struggled-brag-in"}}],"anchors":{"what-i-read-in-past":{"type":"header","text":"What I read in past","value":"what-i-read-in-past","line":76,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["zd4mq442jike0pr0wba1u3m","6hzeqsofq67gdk88flxlkhp","778ijii93yu5uwnrwmn5zi4","g1fngdjl25nes6fs3lip602","ZbdkdApFqLdks4Moq92R9","uoc5hhki3o4py15cesddu8q","9qf7j06jtdkm6rnx9ymvwb0","5zn10cvj7ajy2gh2is5nqmg","4qo9ma0z0yu1czns6pxl7y5","ok0e729ho7o09xetujkxc0m","GR5x8HnNFEN6fU2UBSEIK","yirtnlj8q24yutcf3ss1xqy","eq0wc6t7wl2wv221yb68ro4","7x2fnv4j6gxts08qk0jguny","ettkt3iClONnxpbGwBVLl","7l4knev6v613tbuoskvmbdg","hvh5bud6yp7dc89tuh95tr9","4fvoqrplw0cweo554usbjos","f8qsfql0a9v8thpeo82udfa","1swsbrhqi9jk41v9eodyi5q","SQqYupi6EFddTerBA8RRD","hjNeNc1F2JUh0lTWanH4h","qf0l4wbrc9jgooyzexmbq5v","o7xruzrah5wzqetottecss7","z1zo2mp6ddji5p317i4x9xw","v06c2tjelh341x4resa50fh","0yqesk4rcffwgyuab5x8rfa","sy2vkbtyu671chkvgn1yt8j","ufixpmxoydiccoh59kphrib","alswadkx4wb05y1z9iwfzfv","1daut9dpw70xd0zh5a7j5p4"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nHi there 👋.
