Such renderings look decent but also generic, conventional—like something an AI tool might produce.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/02_boring.png\">drawing of a cup</a></p>\n<p>And they are also… </p>\n<p><strong>boring</strong>.</p>\n<p>Why is that?</p>\n<p>Because they don’t <strong>mean</strong> anything.</p>\n<h2 id=\"meaning\">Meaning<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#meaning\"></a></h2>\n<p>An object, like a cup, can mean many <strong>different things</strong> to us.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/03_meaning.gif\">meanings of a cup</a></p>\n<p>Now the question is: <strong>Which meaning is relevant to you right now?</strong></p>\n<p>And the answer to this question is what makes your drawing interesting. You just need to show it.</p>\n<p>But how?</p>\n<h2 id=\"composition\">Composition<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#composition\"></a></h2>\n<p>We must understand that a <a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/what-is-a-picture/\">drawing is very different</a> from the real thing. For instance, a picture can only show <strong>one view</strong>. So we have to pick the <strong>best view of the object</strong> and decide <strong>where to put it</strong> within the bounds of our paper.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_composition.gif\">compositions of a cup</a></p>\n<p>Or in other words: We need to <strong>compose</strong> the picture. </p>\n<p>And this composition will have a drastic impact on <strong>how the object appears</strong> to us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"principles\">Principles<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#principles\"></a></h2>\n<p>There are no strict rules on how to do this. Instead, artists and designers prefer to speak of <strong>principles</strong> that can guide our decisions. </p>\n<p>Here is a selection of my favourites:</p>\n<h2 id=\"space\">Space<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#space\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/05_space.png\">space</a></p>\n<p>We see the picture plane as an <strong>enclosed space with its own rules</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gravity\">Gravity<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#gravity\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/06_gravity.png\">gravity</a></p>\n<p>These rules are in part shaped by our perceptual habits. For example we <strong>impose our experience of physical laws</strong> on the shapes we see in a picture. Big shapes at the bottom seem to be “heavy”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"relation\">Relation<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#relation\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/07_relation.png\">relation</a></p>\n<p>Just as we recognize <strong>relationships</strong> between things, animals and people in the real world, we see them in visual elements as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chaos--order\">Chaos &#x26; order<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#chaos--order\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/08_chaosorder.png\">chaos &#x26; order</a></p>\n<p>And since we are always searching for <strong>rules that structure our surroundings</strong> we enjoy regular patterns. They give us <a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/immanuel-kant-beauty/\">a soothing sense of an understandable order</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contrast\">Contrast<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#contrast\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/09_contrast.png\">contrast</a></p>\n<p>When individual forms <strong>stand out</strong> from the rest, we notice them first. They seem more important. This is how we can create <strong>visible hierarchies</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"perspective\">Perspective<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#perspective\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10_perspective.png\">perspective</a></p>\n<p>We can also pick a view point in our picture space to <strong>suggest a physical relationship</strong> to the objects. For example, a thing can appear “bigger than me” or “above me”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"depth\">Depth<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#depth\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/11_depth.png\">depth</a></p>\n<p>In this way, we can also suggest <strong>spatial depth</strong>, which implies <strong>a sense of time</strong>. What is close appears “urgent”, things that are farther away “come later”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"harmony\">Harmony<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#harmony\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/12_harmony.png\">harmony</a></p>\n<p>Harmony in a composition suggests that <strong>everything is fine</strong>. The extreme case is perfect symmetry. Yet we can also position elements of different sizes carefully to retain a sense of <strong>balance</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"movement\">Movement<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#movement\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/13_movement.png\">movement</a></p>\n<p>And finally, linear arrangements can <strong>suggest movement</strong> and bring static images to life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"process\">Process<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#process\"></a></h2>\n<p>We can use these principles to show a particular meaning. However, this requires that we are clear about <strong>why</strong> we want to draw that thing in the first place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/14_why.gif\">Why to draw something</a></p>\n<p>But even with a clear goal in mind, the workflow to our composition is rarely straightforward. Like many creative processes, image composition can be messy and unpredictable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/15_process.gif\">composition process</a></p>\n<p>Most of the time, we <strong>try out many variations</strong> to gradually work our way toward a solution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"every-drawing-is-a-self-portrait\">Every drawing is a self portrait<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#every-drawing-is-a-self-portrait\"></a></h2>\n<p>Of course there are more choices to be made about colour, style or <a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/show-me/\">what type of image</a> to create. Yet, I am convinced that composition remains the primary decision. It is the key to <strong>intriguing and authentic drawings</strong> that show more than just lifeless renderings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/16_interesting.png\">interesting variations</a></p>\n<p>Carefully composed drawings can show <strong>our relation to the world</strong>. </p>\n<p>And <strong>that</strong> is interesting.</p>\n<p>It is interesting because we have made a conscious choice of <strong>what is important to us</strong>. And chances are that this is <strong>also interesting for others</strong>. </p>\n<p>So to bring your drawings to the next level—after learning <strong>how</strong> to draw something—is to show <strong>why</strong> you draw it. And then, perhaps your drawing makes us see something <strong>in a new way</strong>: your way.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","title":"Luke","desc":"","updated":1766965759366,"created":1644449449778,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"a724de3efd251cf89fe82a5860d9008b","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"life-tips","position":{"start":{"line":43,"column":5,"offset":2710},"end":{"line":43,"column":29,"offset":2734},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"life-tips","anchorHeader":"wodenokoto"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2026.articles","alias":"What I read in 2026","position":{"start":{"line":72,"column":3,"offset":4440},"end":{"line":72,"column":45,"offset":4482},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2026.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2025.articles","alias":"2025","position":{"start":{"line":73,"column":5,"offset":4487},"end":{"line":73,"column":32,"offset":4514},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2025.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2024.articles","alias":"2024","position":{"start":{"line":74,"column":5,"offset":4519},"end":{"line":74,"column":32,"offset":4546},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2024.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2023.articles","alias":"2023","position":{"start":{"line":75,"column":5,"offset":4551},"end":{"line":75,"column":32,"offset":4578},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2023.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2022.articles","alias":"2022","position":{"start":{"line":76,"column":5,"offset":4583},"end":{"line":76,"column":32,"offset":4610},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2022.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-struggled-brag-in","position":{"start":{"line":82,"column":3,"offset":4746},"end":{"line":82,"column":39,"offset":4782},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-struggled-brag-in"}}],"anchors":{"what-i-read-in-past":{"type":"header","text":"What I read in past","value":"what-i-read-in-past","line":76,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["zd4mq442jike0pr0wba1u3m","6hzeqsofq67gdk88flxlkhp","778ijii93yu5uwnrwmn5zi4","g1fngdjl25nes6fs3lip602","ZbdkdApFqLdks4Moq92R9","uoc5hhki3o4py15cesddu8q","9qf7j06jtdkm6rnx9ymvwb0","5zn10cvj7ajy2gh2is5nqmg","4qo9ma0z0yu1czns6pxl7y5","ok0e729ho7o09xetujkxc0m","GR5x8HnNFEN6fU2UBSEIK","yirtnlj8q24yutcf3ss1xqy","eq0wc6t7wl2wv221yb68ro4","7x2fnv4j6gxts08qk0jguny","ettkt3iClONnxpbGwBVLl","7l4knev6v613tbuoskvmbdg","hvh5bud6yp7dc89tuh95tr9","4fvoqrplw0cweo554usbjos","f8qsfql0a9v8thpeo82udfa","1swsbrhqi9jk41v9eodyi5q","SQqYupi6EFddTerBA8RRD","hjNeNc1F2JUh0lTWanH4h","qf0l4wbrc9jgooyzexmbq5v","o7xruzrah5wzqetottecss7","z1zo2mp6ddji5p317i4x9xw","v06c2tjelh341x4resa50fh","0yqesk4rcffwgyuab5x8rfa","sy2vkbtyu671chkvgn1yt8j","ufixpmxoydiccoh59kphrib","alswadkx4wb05y1z9iwfzfv","1daut9dpw70xd0zh5a7j5p4"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nHi there 👋.
