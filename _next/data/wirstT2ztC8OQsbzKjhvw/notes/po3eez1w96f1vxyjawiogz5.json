led infrastructure at a <a href=\"https://cresta.com/careers/\">startup</a> for the past 4 years that has had to scale quickly. From the beginning I made some core decisions that the company has had to stick to, for better or worse, these past four years. This post will list some of the major decisions made and if I endorse them for your startup, or if I regret them and advise you to pick something else.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aws-link-to-heading\">AWS <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#aws\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#aws-link-to-heading\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"picking-aws-over-google-cloud-link-to-heading\">Picking AWS over Google Cloud <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#picking-aws-over-google-cloud\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#picking-aws-over-google-cloud-link-to-heading\"></a></h3>\n<p>🟩 <em>Endorse</em></p>\n<p>Early on, we were using both GCP and AWS. During that time, I had no idea who my “account manager” was for Google Cloud, while at the same time I had regular cadence meetings with our AWS account manager. There is a feel that Google lives on robots and automation, while Amazon lives with a customer focus. This support has helped us when evaluating new AWS services. Besides support, AWS has done a great job around stability and minimizing backwards incompatible API changes.</p>\n<p>There was a time when Google Cloud was the choice for Kubernetes clusters, especially when there was ambiguity around if AWS would invest in EKS over <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/\">ECS</a>. Now though, with all the extra Kubernetes integrations around AWS services (external-dns, external-secrets, etc), this is not much of any issue anymore.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eks-link-to-heading\"><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/\">EKS</a> <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#ekshttpsawsamazoncomeks\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#eks-link-to-heading\"></a></h3>\n<p>🟩 <em>Endorse</em></p>\n<p>Unless you’re penny-pinching (and your time is free), there’s no reason to run your own control plane rather than use EKS. The main advantage of using an alternative in AWS, like ECS, is the deep integration into AWS services. Luckily, Kubernetes has caught up in many ways: for example, using external-dns to integrate with Route53.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eks-managed-addons-link-to-heading\">EKS <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-add-ons.html\">managed addons</a> <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#eks-managed-addonshttpsdocsawsamazoncomekslatestuserguideeks-add-onshtml\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#eks-managed-addons-link-to-heading\"></a></h3>\n<p>🟧 <em>Regret</em></p>\n<p>We started with EKS managed addons because I thought it was the “right” way to use EKS. Unfortunately, we always ran into a situation where we needed to customize the installation itself. Maybe the CPU requests, the image tag, or some configmap. We’ve since switched to using helm charts for what were add-ons and things are running much better with promotions that fit similar to our existing GitOps pipelines.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rds-link-to-heading\"><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/\">RDS</a> <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#rdshttpsawsamazoncomrds\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#rds-link-to-heading\"></a></h3>\n<p>🟩 <em>Endorse</em></p>\n<p>Data is the most critical part of your infrastructure. You lose your network: that’s downtime. You lose your data: that’s a company ending event.

It’s fast, the API is simple and well documented, and the implementation is battle tested. Unlike other cache options, like Memcached, Redis has a lot of features that make it useful for more than just caching. It’s a great swiss army knife of “do fast data thing”.</p>\n<p>Part of me is unsure what the state of Redis is for Cloud Providers, but I feel it’s so widely used by AWS customers that AWS will continue to support it well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ecr-link-to-heading\"><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/\">ECR</a> <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#ecrhttpsawsamazoncomecr\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#ecr-link-to-heading\"></a></h3>\n<p>🟩 <em>Endorse</em></p>\n<p>We originally hosted on <a href=\"https://quay.io/\">quay.io</a>. It was a hot mess of stability problems. Since moving to ECR, things have been much more stable. The deeper permission integrations with EKS nodes or dev servers has also been a big plus.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aws-vpn-link-to-heading\"><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/\">AWS VPN</a> <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#aws-vpnhttpsawsamazoncomvpn\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#aws-vpn-link-to-heading\"></a></h3>\n<p>🟩 <em>Endorse</em></p>\n<p>There are Zero Trust VPN alternatives from companies like CloudFlare. I’m sure these products work well, but a VPN is just so dead simple to setup and understand (“simplicity is preferable” is my mantra).

We’ve since integrated AFT into our stack and spinning up accounts has worked well since. Another thing AFT makes easier is standardizing tags for our accounts. For example, our production accounts have a tag that we can then use to make peering decisions. Tags work better than organizations for us because the decision of “what properties describe this account” isn’t always a tree structure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"process-link-to-heading\">Process <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#process\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#process-link-to-heading\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"automating-post-mortem-process-with-a-slack-bot-link-to-heading\">Automating post-mortem process with a slack bot <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#automating-post-mortem-process-with-a-slack-bot\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#automating-post-mortem-process-with-a-slack-bot-link-to-heading\"></a></h3>\n<p>🟩 <em>Endorse</em></p>\n<p>Everyone is busy. It can feel like you’re the “bad guy” reminding people to fill out the post-mortem. Making a robot be the bad guy had been great. It streamlines the process by nudging people to follow the SEV and post-mortem procedure.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t have to be too complex to start. Just the basics of “It’s been an hour of no messages. Someone post an update” or “It’s been a day with no calendar invite. Someone schedule the post-mortem meeting” can go a long ways.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-pager-dutys-incident-templates-link-to-heading\">Using pager duty’s incident <a href=\"https://response.pagerduty.com/after/post_mortem_template/\">templates</a> <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#using-pager-dutys-incident-templateshttpsresponsepagerdutycomafterpost_mortem_template\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#using-pager-dutys-incident-templates-link-to-heading\"></a></h2>\n<p>🟩 <em>Endorse</em></p>\n<p>Why reinvent the wheel?

We need alerts.</li>\n<li>We have alerts. There are too many alerts, so we ignore them.</li>\n<li>We’ve prioritized the alerts. Now only the critical ones wake me up.</li>\n<li>We ignore the non-critical alerts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We have a two tiered alerting setup: critical and non-critical. Critical alerts wake people up. Non-critical alerts are expected to ping the on-call async (email). The problem is that non-critical alerts are often ignored. To resolve this, we have regular (usually every 2 weeks) PagerDuty review meetings where we go over all our alerts. For the critical alerts, we discuss if it should stay critical. Then, we iterate the non-critical alerts (usually picking a few each meeting) and discuss what we can do to clear those out as well (usually tweaking the threshold or creating some automation).</p>\n<h3 id=\"monthly-cost-tracking-meetings-link-to-heading\">Monthly cost tracking meetings <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#monthly-cost-tracking-meetings\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#monthly-cost-tracking-meetings-link-to-heading\"></a></h3>\n<p>🟩 <em>Endorse</em></p>\n<p>Early on, I set up a monthly meeting to go over all of our SaaS cost (AWS, DataDog, etc). Previously, this was just something reviewed from a finance perspective, but it’s hard for them to answer general questions around “does this cost number seem right”. During these meetings, usually attended by both finance and engineering, we go over every software related bill we get and do a gut check of “does this cost sound right”. We dive into the numbers of each of the high bills and try to break them down.</p>\n<p>For example, with AWS we group items by tag and separate them by account. These two dimensions, combined with the general service name (EC2, RDS, etc) gives us a good idea of where the major cost drivers are. Some things we do with this data are go deeper into spot instance usage or which accounts contribute to networking costs the most. But don’t stop at just AWS: go into all the major spend sinks your company has.</p>\n<h3 id=\"manging-post-mortems-in-datadog-or-pager-duty-link-to-heading\">Manging post mortems in datadog or pager duty <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#manging-post-mortems-in-datadog-or-pager-duty\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#manging-post-mortems-in-datadog-or-pager-duty-link-to-heading\"></a></h3>\n<p>🟥 <em>Regret</em></p>\n<p>Everyone should do post-mortems. Both <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/product/incident-management/\">DataDog</a> and PagerDuty have integrations to manage writing post-mortems and we tried each. Unfortunately, they both make it hard to customize the post-mortem process. Given how powerful wiki-ish tools like Notion are, I think it’s better to use a tool like that to manage post-mortems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"not-using-function-as-a-servicefaas-more-link-to-heading\">Not using Function as a Service(FaaS) more <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#not-using-function-as-a-servicefaas-more\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#not-using-function-as-a-servicefaas-more-link-to-heading\"></a></h3>\n<p>🟥 <em>Regret</em></p>\n<p>There are no great FaaS options for running GPU workloads, which is why we could never go fully FaaS. However, many CPU workloads could be FaaS (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">lambda</a>, etc). The biggest counter-point people bring up is the cost. They’ll say something like “This EC2 instance type running 24/7 at full load is way less expensive than a Lambda running”. This is true, but it’s also a false comparison. Nobody runs a service at 100% CPU utilization and moves on with their life. It’s always on some scaler that says “Never reach 100%. At 70% scale up another”. And it’s always unclear when to scale back down, instead it’s a heuristic of “If we’ve been at 10% for 10 minutes, scale down”. Then, people assume spot instances when they aren’t always on market.</p>\n<p>Another hidden benefit of Lambda is that it’s very easy to track costs with high accuracy. When deploying services in Kubernetes, cost can get hidden behind other per node objects or other services running on the same node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gitops-link-to-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.gitops.tech/\">GitOps</a> <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#gitopshttpswwwgitopstech\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#gitops-link-to-heading\"></a></h3>\n<p>🟩 <em>Endorse</em></p>\n<p>GitOps has so far scaled pretty well and we use it for many parts of our infrastructure: services, terraform, and config to name a few.

More than just expensive, I’m worried their cost model is especially bad for Kubernetes clusters and for AI companies.

Datadog’s pricing model is based on the number of instances you have and that means even if we have no more than 10 instances up at once, if we spin up and down 20 instances in that hour, we pay for 20 instances. Similarly, AI companies tend to use GPUs heavily.

It’s been easy to extend for other SaaS providers (like Pagerduty), the syntax is easier to read than CloudFormation, and hasn’t been a blocker or slowdown for us.</p>\n<h3 id=\"not-using-more-code-ish-iac-solutions-pulumi-cdk-etc-link-to-heading\">Not using more code-ish IaC solutions (<a href=\"https://www.pulumi.com/\">Pulumi</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/\">CDK</a>, etc) <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#not-using-more-code-ish-iac-solutions-pulumihttpswwwpulumicom-cdkhttpsawsamazoncomcdk-etc\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#not-using-more-code-ish-iac-solutions-pulumi-cdk-etc-link-to-heading\"></a></h3>\n<p>🟩 <em>No Regrets</em></p>\n<p>While Terraform and CloudFormation are data files (HCL and YAML/JSON) that describe your infrastructure, solutions like Pulumi or CDK allow you to write code that does the same. Code is of course powerful, but I’ve found the restrictive nature of Terraform’s HCL to be a benefit with reduced complexity. It’s not that it’s impossible to write complex Terraform: it’s just that it’s more obvious when it’s happening.</p>\n<p>Some of these solutions, like Pulumi, were invented many years ago while Terraform lacked a lot of the features it has today. Newer versions of Terraform have integrated a lot of the features that we can use to reduce complexity. We instead use a middleground that generates basic skeletons of our Terraform code for parts we want to abstract away.</p>\n<h3 id=\"not-using-a-network-mesh-istiolinkerdetc-link-to-heading\">Not using a network mesh (<a href=\"https://istio.io/\">istio</a>/<a href=\"https://linkerd.io/\">linkerd</a>/etc) <a href=\"https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/#not-using-a-network-mesh-istiohttpsistioiolinkerdhttpslinkerdioetc\">Link to heading</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#not-using-a-network-mesh-istiolinkerdetc-link-to-heading\"></a></h3>\n<p>🟩 <em>No regrets</em></p>\n<p>Network meshes are really cool and a lot of smart people tend to endorse them, so I’m convinced they are fine ideas.
