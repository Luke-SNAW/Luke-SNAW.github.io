Usually it's measured in bits per second (<code>b/s</code>). Plumbing is a common analogy — think of bandwidth as how much water can come out of a pipe per second.</em></p>\n<p>Your server doesn't know how much data the connection can handle — so it starts by sending you a small and safe amount of data — usually 10 TCP packets.</p>\n<p>If those packets successfully reach your site's visitor, their computer sends back an acknowledgement (ACK) saying the packets have been received.</p>\n<p>Your server then sends more data back, but this time it doubles the amount of packets.</p>\n<p>This process is repeated until packets are lost and your server doesn't receive an ACK. (At which point the server continues to send packets but at a slower rate).</p>\n<p>That's the gist of TCP slow start — in real life the algorithm varies, but that's essentially how it works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-where-does-14kb-come-from\"><a href=\"https://endtimes.dev/why-your-website-should-be-under-14kb-in-size/#so-where-does-14kb-come-from\">So where does 14kB come from?</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#so-where-does-14kb-come-from\"></a></h2>\n<p>Most web servers TCP slow start algorithm starts by sending 10 TCP packets.</p>\n<p>The maximum size of a TCP packet is <code>1500 bytes</code>.</p>\n<p><em>This maximum is not set by the TCP specification, it comes from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame\">ethernet standard</a></em></p>\n<p>Each TCP packet uses <strong>40 bytes</strong> in its header — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Packet_structure\">16 bytes for IP</a> and an additional <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#TCP_segment_structure\">24 bytes for TCP</a></p>\n<p>That leaves <strong>1460 bytes</strong> per TCP packet. <code>10 x 1460 = 14600 bytes</code> or roughly 14kB!</p>\n<p>So if you can fit your website — or the critical parts of it — into 14kB, you can save visitors a lot of time — the time it takes for one round trip between them and your website's server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-bad-can-one-round-trip-be\"><a href=\"https://endtimes.dev/why-your-website-should-be-under-14kb-in-size/#how-bad-can-one-round-trip-be\">How bad can one round trip be?</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#how-bad-can-one-round-trip-be\"></a></h2>\n<p>...</p>\n<h2 id=\"now-that-you-know-about-the-14kb-rule-what-can-you-do\"><a href=\"https://endtimes.dev/why-your-website-should-be-under-14kb-in-size/#now-that-you-know-about-the-14kb-rule-what-can-you-do\">Now that you know about the 14kB rule, what can you do?</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#now-that-you-know-about-the-14kb-rule-what-can-you-do\"></a></h2>\n<p>Of course, you should make your website as small as possible — <strong>you love your visitors and you want them to be happy</strong>.
