That Supabase is betting on <a href=\"https://deno.com/deploy\">Deno</a> for their <a href=\"https://deno.com/blog/supabase-functions-on-deno-deploy\">serverless function suite</a> indicates to us that they are serious about great technology.</p>\n<p>We love <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a> which Supabase utilizes. We plan to do more research on scalability, since SQL databases can’t grow as big as their NoSQL counterparts.
