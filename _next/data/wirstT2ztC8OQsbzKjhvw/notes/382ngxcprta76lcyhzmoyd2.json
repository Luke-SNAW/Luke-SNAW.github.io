What is Richardson Maturity Model<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#1-what-is-richardson-maturity-model\"></a></h2>\n<p>Leonard Richardson analyzed a hundred different web service designs and divided these designs into four categories. These categories are based on <strong>how much the web services are <a href=\"https://restfulapi.net/rest-architectural-constraints/\">REST compliant</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>This model of division of REST services to identify their maturity level – is called <strong>Richardson Maturity Model</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/back-end/richardson-maturity-model-0.webp\" alt=\"The levels of maturity according to Richardson’s model\"></p>\n<p>Richardson used three main <strong>factors to decide the maturity of a service</strong>. These factors are</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/\">URI</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://restfulapi.net/http-methods/\">HTTP Methods</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://restfulapi.net/hateoas/\">HATEOAS (Hypermedia)</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The more a service employs these factors – the more mature it shall be considered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-maturity-levels\">2. Maturity Levels<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#2-maturity-levels\"></a></h2>\n<p>In his analysis, Richardson described total 4 maturity levels as given below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/back-end/richardson-maturity-model-1.webp\" alt=\"Richardson Maturity Model\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Level Zero</li>\n<li>Level One</li>\n<li>Level Two</li>\n<li>Level Three</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that Roy Fielding has already made it very clear that <a href=\"http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\">level 3 RMM is a pre-condition of REST</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"21-level-zero\">2.1. Level Zero<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#21-level-zero\"></a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Level zero of maturity does not make use of any of URI, HTTP Methods, and HATEOAS capabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The services at zero maturity level have a single URI and use a single HTTP method (typically POST).</p>\n<p>For example, most SOAP Web Services use a single URI to identify an endpoint, and HTTP POST to transfer SOAP-based payloads, effectively ignoring the rest of the HTTP verbs.</p>\n<p>Similarly, XML-RPC-based services send data as <em>Plain Old XML</em> (POX).</p>\n<p>These are the most primitive ways of building SOA applications with a single POST method endpoint and using XML to communicate between the client and the server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"22-level-one\">2.2. Level One<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#22-level-one\"></a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Level one of maturity <strong>makes use of URIs</strong>, but does not use the HTTP Methods, and HATEOAS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The services at maturity level one employ many URIs but only a single HTTP verb – generally HTTP POST.</p>\n<p>These services will give each resource, available in the system, a unique URI. A unique URI separately identifies one unique resource – and that makes these services better than level zero.</p>\n<h3 id=\"23-level-two\">2.3. Level Two<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#23-level-two\"></a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Level two of maturity <strong>makes use of URIs and HTTP Methods</strong>, but does not use the HATEOAS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The level two services generally host numerous URIs i.e. addressable resources.</p>\n<p>Such services support several of the HTTP verbs on each exposed resource – Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) services. Here the state of resources, typically representing business entities, can be manipulated over the network.</p>\n<p>The designers of the level two services expect people to put some effort into mastering the APIs – generally by reading the supplied documentation.</p>\n<p>Maturity level 2 is the most popular usecase of REST principles, which advocate using different verbs based on the HTTP request methods, while the system can have multiple resources.</p>\n<h3 id=\"24-level-three\">2.4. Level Three<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#24-level-three\"></a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Level three of maturity <strong>makes use of all three, i.e. URIs and HTTP, and HATEOAS</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Level three is the most mature level of Richardson’s model, which encourages <strong>easy discoverability</strong>. This level makes it easy for the responses to be self-descriptive by using HATEOAS.</p>\n<p>Level three services lead the service consumers through a trail of resources, causing application state transitions as a result.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crummy.com/writing/speaking/2008-QCon/act3.html\">Act Three: The Maturity Heuristic</a></p>","noteIndex":{"id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","title":"Luke","desc":"","updated":1766965759366,"created":1644449449778,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"a724de3efd251cf89fe82a5860d9008b","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"life-tips","position":{"start":{"line":43,"column":5,"offset":2710},"end":{"line":43,"column":29,"offset":2734},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"life-tips","anchorHeader":"wodenokoto"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2026.articles","alias":"What I read in 2026","position":{"start":{"line":72,"column":3,"offset":4440},"end":{"line":72,"column":45,"offset":4482},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2026.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2025.articles","alias":"2025","position":{"start":{"line":73,"column":5,"offset":4487},"end":{"line":73,"column":32,"offset":4514},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2025.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2024.articles","alias":"2024","position":{"start":{"line":74,"column":5,"offset":4519},"end":{"line":74,"column":32,"offset":4546},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2024.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2023.articles","alias":"2023","position":{"start":{"line":75,"column":5,"offset":4551},"end":{"line":75,"column":32,"offset":4578},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2023.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"read.2022.articles","alias":"2022","position":{"start":{"line":76,"column":5,"offset":4583},"end":{"line":76,"column":32,"offset":4610},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"read.2022.articles"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-struggled-brag-in","position":{"start":{"line":82,"column":3,"offset":4746},"end":{"line":82,"column":39,"offset":4782},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-struggled-brag-in"}}],"anchors":{"what-i-read-in-past":{"type":"header","text":"What I read in past","value":"what-i-read-in-past","line":76,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["zd4mq442jike0pr0wba1u3m","6hzeqsofq67gdk88flxlkhp","778ijii93yu5uwnrwmn5zi4","g1fngdjl25nes6fs3lip602","ZbdkdApFqLdks4Moq92R9","uoc5hhki3o4py15cesddu8q","9qf7j06jtdkm6rnx9ymvwb0","5zn10cvj7ajy2gh2is5nqmg","4qo9ma0z0yu1czns6pxl7y5","ok0e729ho7o09xetujkxc0m","GR5x8HnNFEN6fU2UBSEIK","yirtnlj8q24yutcf3ss1xqy","eq0wc6t7wl2wv221yb68ro4","7x2fnv4j6gxts08qk0jguny","ettkt3iClONnxpbGwBVLl","7l4knev6v613tbuoskvmbdg","hvh5bud6yp7dc89tuh95tr9","4fvoqrplw0cweo554usbjos","f8qsfql0a9v8thpeo82udfa","1swsbrhqi9jk41v9eodyi5q","SQqYupi6EFddTerBA8RRD","hjNeNc1F2JUh0lTWanH4h","qf0l4wbrc9jgooyzexmbq5v","o7xruzrah5wzqetottecss7","z1zo2mp6ddji5p317i4x9xw","v06c2tjelh341x4resa50fh","0yqesk4rcffwgyuab5x8rfa","sy2vkbtyu671chkvgn1yt8j","ufixpmxoydiccoh59kphrib","alswadkx4wb05y1z9iwfzfv","1daut9dpw70xd0zh5a7j5p4"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nHi there 👋.
