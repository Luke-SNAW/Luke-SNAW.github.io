question is not about React going somewhere, some of the alternatives are not “slightly better” rather immensely better, you know that a big company in Brazil is using Svlete for embedded UI for arduino devices not so powerful, performance is a big thing, as devs we want to build the best application possible, we are not business mens looking for turnover, I’m a React developer myself and work as a freelance on a big React project, and let me tell you, if the project was written in Solid it will be 10x easier to maintain, just because of the app re-rendering all the time due to useEffects() thrown everywhere and non memoized functions, objets…it’s a complete mess, anyone that think it’s not big for me it’s because they didn’t work on a big project.</p>\n<p>Thus said i might be completely wrong, but for me i found that Svlete, Solid and Qwik are a superior alternatives, especially Solid, they offer you free optimized code without you thinking about anything, your app will be fully optimized out the box ! it’s huge</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/react-criticism/\">A HISTORICAL REFERENCE OF REACT
