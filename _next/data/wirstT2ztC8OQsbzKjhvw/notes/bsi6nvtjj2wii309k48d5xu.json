We don't need any further documentation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But this statement is only half the truth. There are several questions that remain unanswered in the code.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the goals of the system?</li>\n<li>What are the non-functional requirements?</li>\n<li>What are the architectural decisions and their arguments?</li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://simonbrown.je/\">Simon Brown</a> has correctly pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The code doesn't tell the whole story.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Long story short: You should document the software architecture of your system. Take a look at the <strong>goals</strong> you should fulfil with your documentation, and you'll understand <strong>why</strong>.</p>\n<p>Blog Post: Technical debt due to lack of documentation</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.workingsoftware.dev/technical-debt-scenario-5-the-code-documents-the-system/\">Technical Debt Scenario #5: The code documents the system.</a> - Unfortunately, several long-time developers have left the product team. In addition, there is virtually no technical documentation for the system. Even the architectural decisions are no longer traceable. What would you do to eliminate this kind of technical debt?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"goals-of-software-architecture-documentation\">Goals of software architecture documentation<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#goals-of-software-architecture-documentation\"></a></h3>\n<p>There are three goals that your software architecture documentation should fulfil.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Software architecture documentation creates a common understanding</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Software architecture documentation should at least support the development team, for example, when a new team member starts.</p>\n<p>Let's take the onboarding example, a new team member has a lot of questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where can I find an overview of the system's building blocks?</li>\n<li>Why are you using <a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular</a> and not <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>? Why are you using <a href=\"https://hibernate.org/\">Hibernate</a> and not <a href=\"https://www.jooq.org/\">jOOQ</a>?</li>\n<li>Where and how is the system deployed?</li>\n<li>Are there any conventions I need to be aware of?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This brings us to the first goal of software architecture documentation:</p>\n<p><strong>Software architecture documentation creates a common understanding of the solution behind the system for various stakeholders</strong></p>\n<p>There are usually many different stakeholders interested in different aspects of our system: Software Architects, Software Engineers, Ops, Support, Testing, POs, Project Managers, SMEs, Business Sponsors and so on.</p>\n<p>You can create different views of your system's architecture by developing a common understanding of your system's software architecture.</p>\n<p>With this understanding, the various stakeholders can evaluate the underlying software architecture from their perspective.</p>\n<p>In this way, we can concretize the goal described above with the evaluation part:</p>\n<p><strong>The documentation makes it possible to evaluate the software architecture from the perspective of the various stakeholders</strong></p>\n<p>Software architecture documentation allows your stakeholders to judge whether the system is achieving the goal, since they often can't dive into the code.</p>\n<p>With good architecture documentation, they can answer the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the chosen architecture fit the solution?</li>\n<li>Is the architecture appropriate?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this way, architectural documentation often prevents other goals, constraints, and non-functional requirements from creeping in.</p>\n<p>Let me give a practical example here.</p>\n<p>I've often heard from various stakeholders: \"<em>The system must be fast</em>.\"</p>\n<p>But what does that mean?</p>\n<p>As a software architect, you have to turn these expectations into concrete quality goals, i.e., non-functional requirements with supporting quality scenarios. You record these quality goals in the architecture documentation, which in turn helps your team to implement the solution with the agreed non-functional requirements.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Software architecture documentation supports architectural work</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Software architecture documentation supports team work</strong></p>\n<p>Software architecture is a team effort, so it's most important that the software architecture documentation supports your team effort.</p>\n<p>See also this article about the role of the software architect</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.workingsoftware.dev/do-we-need-a-software-architect-in-our-agile-team/\">Do we need a software architect in our agile team?</a> - This question often comes up in agile teams. In this blog post, we look for the answer to this question in the context of the various agile and organisational frameworks like Scrum, LeSS, SAFe, Disciplined Agile and draw a conclusion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a team member, it's important to actively know (and pass on to new team members) the goals, constraints, and non-functional requirements within the team. This information is often very important in team architecture workshops.</p>\n<p>It's important to make understandable and comprehensible architecture decisions. Nothing is more annoying than not knowing why you decided the way you did.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Software architecture documentation guides the development team in implementing new product features</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Documenting software architecture helps the entire development team implement the solution.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What <em>constraints</em> do I need to consider?</li>\n<li>Which <em>non-functional</em> requirements do I need to test?</li>\n<li>Which <em>overarching</em> concepts do I need to follow?</li>\n<li>Are there architectural decisions I need to consider when implementing a particular feature?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Software architecture documentation supports the communication with external stakeholders</strong></p>\n<p>A large part of software architecture work is communication. In particular, communication with stakeholders is key to effective and focused discussion outcomes.</p>\n<p>Good software architecture documentation supports communication with external stakeholders. It contains different and stakeholder-appropriate views of the software architecture.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-should-we-structure-software-architecture-documentation\">How should we structure software architecture documentation?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#how-should-we-structure-software-architecture-documentation\"></a></h3>\n<p>An proven approach to structuring software architecture documentation is the <a href=\"https://arc42.org/\">arc42 template</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-arc42-template\">What is the arc42 template?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#what-is-the-arc42-template\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arc42.org/\">arc42</a> provides a template for documenting and communicating software<br>\nand system architectures.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arc42.org/\">arc42</a> is based on practical experience of many systems in various domains,<br>\nfrom information and web systems, real-time and embedded to business<br>\nintelligence and data warehouses.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arc42.org/\">arc42</a> supports arbitrary technologies and tools.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arc42.org/\">arc42</a> is completely process independent and is particularly well suited for lean and agile development approaches.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arc42.org/\">arc42</a> is open source and can be used free of charge in both the commercial and private sectors.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arc42.org/\">arc42</a> is available in several languages.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arc42.org/\">arc42</a> is available in different formats like .adoc, .docx, .rst, .md, .tex, ...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GitHub Repository of the arc42 Template</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/arc42/arc42-template\">GitHub - arc42/arc42-template: arc42 - the template for software architecture documentation and communication</a> - the template for software architecture documentation and communication</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"how-is-the-software-architecture-according-to-the-arc42-template-structured\">How is the Software Architecture according to the arc42 template structured?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#how-is-the-software-architecture-according-to-the-arc42-template-structured\"></a></h3>\n<p>The following figure shows the resulting structure of the <a href=\"https://www.workingsoftware.dev/software-architecture-documentation-the-ultimate-guide/arc42.de\">arc42</a> template.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.workingsoftware.dev/content/images/2022/12/image-50.png\"></p>\n<p>The structure of the arc42 template (<a href=\"https://dev.to/arc42/brief-introduction-to-arc42-1c0l\">Source</a>)</p>\n<h3 id=\"good-examples-of-an-arc42-documentation\">Good examples of an arc42 documentation<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#good-examples-of-an-arc42-documentation\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://hsc.aim42.org/documentation/hsc_arc42.html\">HTML Sanity Checker (HtmlSC) Architecture Documentation</a> (Gernot Starke)<br>\nHTML Sanity Checker (HtmlSC) shall support authors creating digital formats<br>\nwith hyperlinks and integration of images and similar resources.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dokchess.de/\">DokChess</a> (Stefan Zörner) 🇩🇪<br>\nDokChess is a fully functional chess engine.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.embarc.de/arc42-starschnitt-gradle/\">Gradle as an example for arc42</a> (Stefan Zörner) 🇩🇪<br>\nGradle automates the building, testing and delivery of software.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"are-there-any-possible-pitfalls-in-the-handling-with-arc42\">Are there any possible pitfalls in the handling with arc42?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#are-there-any-possible-pitfalls-in-the-handling-with-arc42\"></a></h3>\n<p>❌ <strong>Upfront document everything</strong></p>\n<p>Don't document everything in advance.
