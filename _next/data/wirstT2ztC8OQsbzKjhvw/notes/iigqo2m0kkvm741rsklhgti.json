explained</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I spend a significant amount of my time online, and on a regular day, I am either learning about STEM topics, indulging in memes, or both. On one such day, I came across a meme that truly caught my attention. It sparked numerous questions above my head, leading to a moment of deafening silence within me:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27904%27%20height=%271280%27/%3e\"><img src=\"/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fposts%2Fpostgres-meme%2Fpostgres-meme.jpg&#x26;w=1920&#x26;q=75\" alt=\"The Legendary Postgres meme\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fposts%2Fpostgres-meme%2Fpostgres-meme.jpg&#x26;w=1920&#x26;q=75\" alt=\"The Legendary Postgres meme\"></p>\n<p>I already knew that data storage and retrieval ain't ever been one of my strong suits, but after seeing this meme it kind of made me unsecure as I had basically zero effing clue about a huge portion of it. I felt the urge that I have to know what this is all about, so I have decided to learn from multiple sources.</p>\n<p>One of the best ways to learn something is to explain it, and this blog post aims to do exactly that. Let's review and explain every part of this meme, while unraveling its meaning and secrets.</p>\n<h4 id=\"credits\">CREDITS<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#credits\"></a></h4>\n<p>Shout out to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/largedatabank\">Jordan Lewis</a> (and friends) for creating this meme. This was initially <a href=\"https://twitter.com/largedatabank/status/1559651463919452161\">published in a tweet on twitter</a> and then went viral on other social platforms. I've personally seen it on a Telegram group, and didn't know about the origin of it while I was writing this blog post until I've finished writing about the half of it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"attention\">ATTENTION<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#attention\"></a></h4>\n<p>The meme is called \"The SQL Iceberg\" and it is a general SQL meme, not a PostgreSQL one. However, as we want to analyze it while wearing our PostgreSQL hat, I think it is safe to title this post \"Explaining The Postgres Meme\", because it is hard to target all or even major database management systems in one blog post for such a highly detailed photo. The creators of this meme happen to be the developers of CockroachDB, which is a <a href=\"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/postgresql-compatibility\">highly compatible database with PostgreSQL</a>, so we are probably not much far from what they had in mind when creating this meme.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Midway through writing this blog post, I discovered the origin of this meme and watched the creator's explanations. It seems that the content of this post aligns closely with the creator's intentions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"levels\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#levels\"></a>Levels<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#levels\"></a></h2>\n<p>Let's name each level in the meme:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#level-0-sky-zone\">Level 0: Sky Zone</a>: <code>CREATE TABLE</code>, <code>JOIN</code>, <code>NULL</code>, ...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#level-1-surface-zone\">Level 1: Surface Zone</a>: ACID, outer joins, normal forms, ...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#level-2-sunlight-zone\">Level 2: Sunlight Zone</a>: Connection pools, LATERAL Join, Stored Procedures, ...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#level-3-twilight-zone\">Level 3: Twilight Zone</a>: Isolation levels, ZigZag Join, Triggers, ...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#level-4-midnight-zone\">Level 4: Midnight Zone</a>: Denormalization, <code>SELECT FOR UPDATE</code>, star schemas, ...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#level-5-abyssal-zone\">Level 5: Abyssal Zone</a>: <code>MATCH PARTIAL</code> foreign keys, <code>null::jsonb IS NULL = false</code>, ...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#level-6-hadal-zone\">Level 6: Hadal Zone</a>: volcano model, join ordering is NP Hard, ...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#level-7-pitch-black-zone\">Level 7: Pitch Black Zone</a>: <code>NULL</code>, the halloween problem, fsyncgate, ...</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"level-0-sky-zone\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#level-0-sky-zone\"></a>Level 0: Sky Zone<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#level-0-sky-zone\"></a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"/data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27904%27%20height=%27152%27/%3e\"><img src=\"/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fposts%2Fpostgres-meme%2Flevels%2Fsky.jpg&#x26;w=1920&#x26;q=75\" alt=\"The Legendary Postgres meme\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fposts%2Fpostgres-meme%2Flevels%2Fsky.jpg&#x26;w=1920&#x26;q=75\" alt=\"The Legendary Postgres meme\"></p>\n<p>Welcome to Sky Zone! These are the very high level concepts which everyone seem to have encountered while working with Relational Database Management Systems like PostgreSQL. Without any further ado, let's get into the topics on the sky level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data-types\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#data-types\"></a>Data Types<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#data-types\"></a></h3>\n<p>PostgreSQL supports a large number of different data types varying from numeric, monetary, arrays, json, and xml to things like geometric, network address, and composite types. Here is <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html\">a long list of supported data types is PostgreSQL</a>.</p>\n<p>This query shows the types that are interesting to an application developer. It results <strong>87</strong> different data types on PostgreSQL version 14.1:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> typname<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> typlen<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> nspname\n<span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> pg_type t\n<span class=\"token keyword\">join</span> pg_namespace n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">on</span> t<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>typnamespace <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> n<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>oid\n<span class=\"token keyword\">where</span> nspname <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'pg_catalog'</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">and</span> typname <span class=\"token operator\">!</span><span class=\"token operator\">~</span> <span class=\"token string\">'(^_|^pg_|^reg|_handlers$)'</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">order</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">by</span> nspname<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> typname<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>As an example, if you want to store the audit logs of the actions done by admin users and need to store their IPs, you can use the <code>inet</code> type in PostgreSQL instead of storing it as <code>text</code>. This will help you to store those data more efficiently, and validate them more easily, compared to a system that doesn't support such a type (e.g. Sqlite).</p>\n<h3 id=\"create-table\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#create-table\"></a><code>CREATE TABLE</code><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#create-table\"></a></h3>\n<p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is composed of several areas, and each of them has a specific sub-language.</p>\n<p>One of these sub-languages is called <strong>DDL</strong> which stands for <em>data definition language</em>. It consists of statements like <code>CREATE</code>, <code>ALTER</code>, and <code>DROP</code>, which are used to defined on-disk data structures.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of a create table query:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">create</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">table</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"audit_log\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n\tid <span class=\"token keyword\">serial</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">primary</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">key</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\tip inet<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\t<span class=\"token keyword\">action</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">text</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\tactor <span class=\"token keyword\">text</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\tdescription <span class=\"token keyword\">text</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\tcreated_at <span class=\"token keyword\">timestamp</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">default</span> <span class=\"token function\">NOW</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will create an <code>audit_log</code> table with columns such as <code>id</code>, <code>ip</code>, <code>action</code>, etc.</p>\n<h3 id=\"select-insert-update-delete\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#select-insert-update-delete\"></a><code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#select-insert-update-delete\"></a></h3>\n<p><strong>DML</strong> is another one of SQL sub-languages and stands for <em>data manipulation language</em>. It covers the <code>insert</code>, <code>update</code>, and <code>delete</code> statements which are used to feed data into the database system.</p>\n<p><code>select</code> also helps us to retrieve data from the database.

Now that we have got past the sky level, we can get familiar with some of the more advanced features and concepts and dive deeper into the fundamental components and functionalities of PostgreSQL . These topics will give you a solid grounding and understanding of the database system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"transactions\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#transactions\"></a>Transactions<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#transactions\"></a></h3>\n<p>A transaction turns a bundle of steps/actions into a single \"all or nothing\" operation. The intermediate steps are not visible to other concurrently running transactions. Generally speaking, a transaction represents any change in a database.</p>\n<p>In PostgreSQL, a transaction is surrounded by <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>COMMIT</code> commands. PostgreSQL treats every SQL statement as being executed within a transaction. If you do not issue a <code>BEGIN</code> command, then each individual statement has an implicit <code>BEGIN</code> and (if successful) <code>COMMIT</code> wrapped around it. The below example shows transferring of a coin from Player1 to Player2 in the database of a video game server (the example is oversimplified):</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">BEGIN</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">update</span> accounts <span class=\"token keyword\">set</span> coins <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> coins <span class=\"token operator\">-</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">where</span> name <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Player1\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">update</span> accounts <span class=\"token keyword\">set</span> coins <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> coins <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">where</span> name <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Player2\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">COMMIT</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we want to make sure that either all the updates are applied to database, or none of them happen. We do not want a system failure decrease coins from Player1, but no coin is added to Player2's inventory. Grouping a set of operations into a transaction gives us such guarantee.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acid\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#acid\"></a>ACID<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#acid\"></a></h3>\n<p>ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps.</p>\n<p>A database transaction should be ACID by definition:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Atomicity:</strong> A transaction must either be complete in its entirety, or have no effect. Atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single \"unit\".</li>\n<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one consistent state to another, and prevent database corruption by an illegal transaction. As an example, a transaction should not allow a <code>NOT NULL</code> column to have a <code>NULL</code> value after a <code>COMMIT</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Transactions are often executed concurrently (multiple reads and writes at a time). As we have stated in the previous section, the intermediate steps are not visible to other concurrently running transactions, which means a concurrently executed transaction shouldn't have a different result compared to when the transactions were executed sequentially.</li>\n<li><strong>Durability:</strong> The database management system is not allowed to miss any committed transaction after a restart or any kind of crash. All the committed transactions should be written on non-volatile memory.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"query-plans-and-explain\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#query-plans-and-explain\"></a>Query plans and EXPLAIN<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#query-plans-and-explain\"></a></h3>\n<p>Every database system needs a <em>planner</em> to create a <em>query plan</em> out of your SQL queries. A good query planner is critical for good performance. In PostgreSQL, the <code>EXPLAIN</code> command is used to know what query plan is created for the input query.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">explain</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"author\"</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"book\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">-- output:</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">-- Seq Scan on book  (cost=0.00..18.80 rows=880 width=64)</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>For a more complex query like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">select</span>\n\tw<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>temp_lo<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\tw<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>temp_hi<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\tw<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>city<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\tc<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>location <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> city_location\n<span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> weather <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> w\n<span class=\"token keyword\">join</span> city <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> c\n<span class=\"token keyword\">on</span> c<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>name <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> w<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>city<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>We get more information on things like how is PostgreSQL trying to find the record (using a sequential scan or hash, etc), costs, timing, and performance information.

key occurs.</p>\n<p>Inverted indexes are used when we want to index composite values (called an <em>item</em>), where each element value in the item is a key. As an example, a document is an item, and the word we're searching for inside the document is the key.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/static/images/posts/postgres-meme/inverted-index.svg\" alt=\"Explain Plan from pgAdmin\"></p>\n<p>PostgreSQL supports GIN, which stands for Generalized Inverted Index.

As we have suggested in the <code>OFFSET</code>/<code>LIMIT</code> section, in many cases using offset will slow down the performance of your query as the database must count all rows from the beginning until it reaches the requested page. One way to overcome this is to use the Keyset pagination:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"audit_log\"</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">where</span> created_at <span class=\"token operator\">&#x3C;</span> ?\n<span class=\"token keyword\">limit</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">-- equivalent standard SQL: fetch first 10 rows only</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here instead of skipping records, we simply use <code>keyset_column > x</code> where <code>x</code> is the last record from the previous page we have fetched.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read more: <a href=\"https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/partial-results/fetch-next-page\">Paging Through Results by Markus Winand</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"computed-columns\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#computed-columns\"></a>Computed Columns<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#computed-columns\"></a></h3>\n<p>A computed or a generated column in a table is a column which its value is a function of other column in the same row. In other words, a computed column for columns is what a view is for tables. The value of a computed column can be read, but it can not be directly written. A computed/generated column is defined using <code>GENERATED ALWAYS AS</code> in PostgreSQL:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">create</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">table</span> people <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n\t<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    height_cm <span class=\"token keyword\">numeric</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    height_in <span class=\"token keyword\">numeric</span> GENERATED ALWAYS <span class=\"token keyword\">AS</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>height_cm <span class=\"token operator\">/</span> <span class=\"token number\">2.54</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">-- this won't work, will explain why in the next section</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"stored-columns\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#stored-columns\"></a>Stored Columns<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#stored-columns\"></a></h3>\n<p>A generated column can either be <code>stored</code> or <code>virtual</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stored: computed when it is written (inserted or updated) and occupies storage as if it were a normal column</li>\n<li>Virtual: occupies no storage and is computed when it is read</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, a virtual generated column is similar to a view and a stored generated column is similar to a materialized view (except that it is always updated automatically).</p>\n<p>If you have tried the previous query you might have faced an error.

Some of the most famous aggregate functions are <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>sum</code>, and <code>avg</code> which are used to calculate minimum, maximum, sum, and the average of a set of results. The query below calculates the average of high and low temperatures from the weather records in the weather table:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">select</span>\n\t<span class=\"token function\">avg</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>temp_lo<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> temp_lo_average<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\t<span class=\"token function\">avg</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>temp_hi<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> temp_hi_average\n<span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> weather<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The input of some aggregate functions are introduced by <code>ORDER BY</code>.

Connection pools are a way to further improve performance by pooling users’ connections to a database. The idea is to decrease the total number of connections that must be opened. Whenever a client wants to connect to the database, an open connection from the pool is reused instead of creating a new one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/static/images/posts/postgres-meme/connection-pool.svg\" alt=\"Explain Plan from pgAdmin\"></p>\n<p>There are many tools and libraries for different programming languages which can help you create connection pools, as well as server-side connection pooling software that works for all connection types, not just within a single software stack.

This table is used for situations when you want to <code>select</code> something but no <code>from</code> clause is needed. In Oracle, <code>FROM</code> clause is mandatory, so you would need the <code>dual</code> table. However, in PostgreSQL, creating such table is not required as you can <code>select</code> without a <code>from</code> clause.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token comment\">--- postgresql</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">-- oracle</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> dual<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>That being said, this table can be created in postgres as a view to ease porting problems from Oracle to PostgreSQL. This allows code to remain somewhat compatible with Oracle SQL without annoying the Postgres parser:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">create</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">table</span> dual<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"lateral-joins\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#lateral-joins\"></a>LATERAL Joins<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#lateral-joins\"></a></h3>\n<p>PostgreSQL added the LATERAL join technique since PostgreSQL 9.3. Using lateral joins, you can look at the left hand table:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> weather <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> w\n<span class=\"token keyword\">join</span> lateral <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n\t<span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> city<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>location\n\t<span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> city\n\t<span class=\"token keyword\">where</span> city<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>name <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> w<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>city <span class=\"token comment\">-- only possible to reference \"w\" because of lateral</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> c <span class=\"token keyword\">on</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above query, the inner subquery became a <em>correlated subquery</em> to the outer <code>select</code> query. Without lateral, each subquery is evaluated independently and as a result, cannot cross-reference any other <code>FROM</code> item. You would get this error if you haven't used <code>LATERAL</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>ERROR: invalid reference to FROM-clause entry for table \"w\"\nHINT: There is an entry for table \"w\", but it cannot be referenced from this part of the query.\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"recursive-ctes\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#recursive-ctes\"></a>Recursive CTEs<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#recursive-ctes\"></a></h3>\n<p><code>WITH</code> clauses can be used with the optional <code>RECURSIVE</code> option.

Some people use ORMs to write code using the language structures provided by their programming language, rather than crafting SQL queries themselves. The ORM serves as a layer between the relational database and the application, generating the necessary queries.</p>\n<p>On the downside, ORMs abstract away database features, can be more challenging to debug than raw queries, and occasionally generate suboptimal queries that are significantly slower than well-written SQL for the same task. One well-known issue is the N+1 query problem.</p>\n<p>Let's assume we want to retrieve a blog post along with its comments. A common mistake we often encounter is the N+1 query problem: One <code>select</code> query to fetch the post and n additional queries to select comments for each post (n + 1 queries in total). This is easy to fix in raw SQL with a simple join. However, when using an ORM, you have less control on the generated queries, and it can sometimes be challenging to determine whether you've encountered this problem or not without using a profiler:</p>\n<p>N+1 RoundtripFix with Join</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token comment\">-- one query to fetch the posts</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> id<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> title <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> blog_post<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">-- N query in a loop to fetch the comments of each post:</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> body <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> comments <span class=\"token keyword\">where</span> post_id <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> :post_id<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"stored-procedures\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#stored-procedures\"></a>Stored Procedures<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#stored-procedures\"></a></h3>\n<p>Stored procedures are server-side procedures with names that are typically written in various languages, with SQL being the most common.

This is in contrast to most database engines that restrict you to using only a predefined set of languages.</p>\n<p>Additional languages can be easily integrated into the PostgreSQL server using the <code>CREATE LANGUAGE</code> command:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">create</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">language</span> myLovelyLanguage\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">handler</span> my_language_handler <span class=\"token comment\">-- the function that glue postgresql with any external language</span>\n  validator my_language_validator <span class=\"token comment\">-- check syntax errors before executing function</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Functions are a concept similar to stored procedures, but they are distinct entities. Traditionally, people used the term \"Stored Procedure\" to refer to both, but there are differences between them. One key distinction is that functions can return values, whereas stored procedures do not. However, this is not the only difference.</p>\n<p>One of the most significant differences between stored procedures and functions is that functions can be used within a <code>SELECT</code> statement, but they cannot start or commit transactions:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> my_func<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>last_name<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> person<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>On the other hand, stored procedures can start and commit transactions, but they can not be used inside select statements.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">call</span> sp_can_commit_a_transaction<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>In short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Functions have return values, but stored procedures do not.</li>\n<li>Functions can be used in <code>select</code> statements, but stored procedures do not.</li>\n<li>Functions can not start or commit transactions, but stored procedures can.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's also a concept called <code>Trigger Functions</code>, but we will talk about them when we're deeper in the ocean!</p>\n<h3 id=\"cursors\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#cursors\"></a>Cursors<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#cursors\"></a></h3>\n<p>The idea behind <code>CURSOR</code> is that the data is generated only when needed (via a <code>FETCH</code>). This mechanism allows us to consume the result set while the database is generating the results. In contrast, it avoids waiting for the database engine to complete its work and send all the results at once:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">declare</span> my_cursor scroll <span class=\"token keyword\">cursor</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> films<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">-- you can read more about SCROLL in the collapsible box</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">fetch</span> forward <span class=\"token number\">5</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> my_cursor<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">-- FORWARD is the direction, PostgreSQL supports many directions.</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">-- Outputs five rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">-- Cursor is now at position 5</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">fetch</span> prior <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> my_cursor<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">-- outputs row number 4, PRIOR is also a direction.</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">close</span> my_cursor<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Click for more details: What is an scroll cursor?</p>\n<h3 id=\"there-are-no-non-nullable-types\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#there-are-no-non-nullable-types\"></a>There are no non-nullable types<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#there-are-no-non-nullable-types\"></a></h3>\n<p>As mentioned previously, SQL's <code>null</code> is a marker, not a value. SQL <code>null</code> means unknown, and not having nullable types means we can control the nullability of columns solely through the use of <code>not null</code> check constraints.</p>\n<p>This approach results in flexible data types where any user of the database can input data into the system, even if the data for a column with such a data type is missing or unknown.</p>\n<p>PostgreSQL permits the creation of user-defined types using <code>CREATE TYPE</code>, and it's possible to specify a default for the data type in case a user desires columns of that data type to default to something other than a <code>null</code> value. However, it remains valid to set the column value to <code>null</code> if there are no <code>not null</code> check constraints defined.</p>\n<h3 id=\"optimizers-dont-work-without-table-statistics\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#optimizers-dont-work-without-table-statistics\"></a>Optimizers don't work without table statistics<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#optimizers-dont-work-without-table-statistics\"></a></h3>\n<p>As previously mentioned, PostgreSQL strives to generate an optimal execution plan for your SQL queries. Various plans can produce the same result set, but a well-designed planner/optimizer can produce a faster and more efficient execution plan.</p>\n<p>Query optimization is an art of science, and in order to come up with a good plan, PostgreSQL needs data. PostgreSQL uses a <em>cost-based optimizer</em> which utilizes data statistics, not static rules. The planner/optimizer <em>estimates</em> the cost of each step in the plan, and picks a plan that has the least cost for the system. Additionally, PostgreSQL switches to a <em>Genetic Query Optimizer</em> when the number of joins exceeds a defined threshold (set by the <code>geqo_threshold</code> variable). This is because among all relational operators, joins are often the most complex and challenging to process and optimize.</p>\n<p>As a result, PostgreSQL is equipped with a <em>cumulative statistics system</em> which collects and reports information related to the database server activities. These statistics can come in handy for the optimizer. You can read more about the statistics that PostgreSQL collect at <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html\">The Cumulative Statistics System</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"plan-hints\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#plan-hints\"></a>Plan hints<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#plan-hints\"></a></h3>\n<p>As we already know, PostgreSQL does its best to come up with a good plan execution using statistics, estimates, and guessing. While this approach is generally effective for optimizing user queries, there are situations where users may want to provide hints to the database engine to manually influence certain decisions in execution plans.</p>\n<p>These hints can make their way to the planner/optimizer using approaches like the <code>pg_hint_plan</code> project and adding SQL Comments before the queries:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token comment\">/*+ SeqScan(users) */</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">explain</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> users <span class=\"token keyword\">where</span> id <span class=\"token operator\">&#x3C;</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">--                      QUERY PLAN</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">-- ------------------------------------------------------</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">-- Seq Scan on a  (cost=0.00..1483.00 rows=10 width=47)</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The comment <code>/*+ SeqScan(users) */</code> instructs the planner to utilize a sequential scan when searching for items in the \"users\" table. Similarly, hints for joins can be provided using <code>HashJoin(weather city)</code> syntax within the comment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mvcc-garbage-collection\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#mvcc-garbage-collection\"></a>MVCC Garbage Collection<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#mvcc-garbage-collection\"></a></h3>\n<p>MVCC stands for Multiversion Concurrency Control. Every database engine needs to somehow manage concurrent access to data, and PostgreSQL as an advanced database engine is no exception. As the name suggests, MVCC is the concurrency control mechanism inside Postgres. Multiversion means that each statement sees it's own version of the database (aka snapshot) as it was sometimes ago. This prevents statements from viewing inconsistent data.</p>\n<p>MVCC enables the read and write locks not to conflict with each other, so reading never blocks writing and writing never blocks reading (and PostgreSQL was the first database to be designed with this feature).</p>\n<p>Keeping multiple copies/versions of data produces garbage data that takes a lot of space on the disk which degrades the performance of the database in the long run. Postgres uses <code>VACUUM</code> to garbage-collect data. <code>VACUUM</code> reclaims storage occupied by dead tuples, which are tuples that are deleted or obsoleted by an update are not physically removed from their table. It is necessary to do <code>VACUUM</code> periodically, especially on frequently-updated tables, hence why PostgreSQL includes an “autovacuum” facility which can automate routine vacuum maintenance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read more: <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/deep-dive-into-postgresql-vacuum-garbage-collector\">Google Cloud Blogs: A deep dive into VACUUM FAQs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"level-3-twilight-zone\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#level-3-twilight-zone\"></a>Level 3: Twilight Zone<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#level-3-twilight-zone\"></a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"/data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27904%27%20height=%27156%27/%3e\"><img src=\"/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fposts%2Fpostgres-meme%2Flevels%2Ftwilight.jpg&#x26;w=1920&#x26;q=75\" alt=\"The Legendary Postgres meme\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fposts%2Fpostgres-meme%2Flevels%2Ftwilight.jpg&#x26;w=1920&#x26;q=75\" alt=\"The Legendary Postgres meme\"></p>\n<p>Welcome to Twilight Zone!

A transaction must be isolated from other concurrent transactions running in the database. As an example, when you want to backup your database using tools like <code>pg_dump</code>, you don't want your backup to be affected by other write operations in the system.</p>\n<p>The SQL standard defines 4 levels of transaction isolation. These isolation level are defined in terms of <em>phenomena</em>, and each of these levels either prohibits these <em>phenomena</em>, or does not guarantee of them not happening. The phenomena are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>dirty read:</strong> A transaction reads data written by a concurrent uncommitted transaction.</li>\n<li><strong>nonrepeatable read</strong>: A transaction re-reads data it has previously read and finds that data has been modified by another transaction (that committed since the initial read).</li>\n<li><strong>phantom read</strong>: A transaction re-executes a query returning a set of rows that satisfy a search condition and finds that the set of rows satisfying the condition has changed due to another recently-committed transaction.</li>\n<li><strong>serialization anomaly</strong>: The result of successfully committing a group of transactions is inconsistent with all possible orderings of running those transactions one at a time. Write skew is the simplest form of serialization anomaly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The four isolation levels in databases are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Read uncommitted</code></li>\n<li><code>Read committed</code></li>\n<li><code>Repeatable read (aka Snapshot Isolation, or Anomaly Serializable)</code></li>\n<li><code>Serializable (aka Serializable Snapshot Isolation)</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's important to note that PostgreSQL does not implement the <code>read uncommitted</code> isolation level. Instead, PostgreSQL's <em>Read Uncommitted</em> mode behaves like <em>Read Committed</em>. This is because it is the only sensible way to map the standard isolation levels to PostgreSQL's multiversion concurrency control architecture. This approach aligns with the SQL Standard because the standard defines the minimum guarantees, not the maximum ones. Therefore, PostgreSQL can and does disallow <em>phantom reads</em> even in the <em>repeatable read</em> isolation level:</p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>Isolation Level</th><th>Dirty Read</th><th>Nonrepeatable Read</th><th>Phantom Read</th><th>Serialization Anomaly</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Read uncommitted</td><td>⚠️ Possible (✅ not in PG)</td><td>⚠️ Possible</td><td>⚠️ Possible</td><td>⚠️ Possible</td></tr><tr><td>Read committed</td><td>✅ Not possible</td><td>⚠️ Possible</td><td>⚠️ Possible</td><td>⚠️ Possible</td></tr><tr><td>Repeatable read</td><td>✅ Not possible</td><td>✅ Not possible</td><td>⚠️ Possible (✅ not in PG)</td><td>⚠️ Possible</td></tr><tr><td>Serializable</td><td>✅ Not possible</td><td>✅ Not possible</td><td>✅ Not possible</td><td>✅ Not possible</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<p>The term \"Serializable\" execution means that a transaction can run as if it has a \"serial execution,\" where no concurrent operation is affecting it.</p>\n<p>Click for more details: PostgreSQL Serializable Isolation is an art of science!</p>\n<h3 id=\"write-skew\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#write-skew\"></a>Write skew<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#write-skew\"></a></h3>\n<p>Write skew is the simplest form of serialization anomaly, and the Serializable isolation level protects you from it. However, the Repeatable Read isolation level does not provide the same protection against write skew.</p>\n<p>Assume a table with a column which has either <code>Black</code> or <code>White</code> as the value. Two users concurrently try to make all rows contain matching color values, but their attempts go in opposite directions. One is trying to update all white rows to black and the other is trying to update all black rows to white.</p>\n<p>In such a case, two concurrent transactions each determine what they are writing based on reading a data set (rows with black/white column), and that dataset overlaps what the other is writing. In this case we can get a state which could not occur if either had run before the other</p>\n<p>If these updates are run serially, all colors will match: one of the transactions turn all rows to white, and the other turns all rows to black. If they are run concurrently in <code>REPEATABLE READ</code> mode, the values will be switched, which is not consistent with any serial order of runs. If they are run concurrently in <code>SERIALIZABLE</code> mode, PostgreSQL's Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI) will notice the write skew and roll back one of the transactions.</p>\n<p>Read more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/SSI\">PostgreSQL's Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI) vs plain Snapshot Isolation (SI)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Serializable\">PostgreSQL's Serializable Wiki</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"serializable-restarts-require-retry-loops-on-all-statements\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#serializable-restarts-require-retry-loops-on-all-statements\"></a>Serializable restarts require retry loops on all statements<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#serializable-restarts-require-retry-loops-on-all-statements\"></a></h3>\n<p>Restarting a serializable transaction requires retry on all the statements of the transaction, not just the failed one.

clause, and is useful when you know that the column values are unique only in certain circumstances. One major use-case for partial indexes is for the times that you don't want to put common items in the index, as their frequent changes can increase the size of index and slow the index down because of the recurring updates.</p>\n<p>As an example, let's assume that most of your customers have the same nationality (at least 25% or so), and there are just a handful of different values in the table, it could be a good idea to create a partial index on the column:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">create</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">index</span> nationality_idx <span class=\"token keyword\">on</span> person<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>nationality<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">where</span> nationality <span class=\"token operator\">not</span> <span class=\"token operator\">in</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'american'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'iranian'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'indian'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"generator-functions-zip-when-cross-joined\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#generator-functions-zip-when-cross-joined\"></a>Generator functions zip when cross joined<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#generator-functions-zip-when-cross-joined\"></a></h3>\n<p>Generator functions, also known as <em>Set Returning Functions (SRF)</em>, are functions that can return more than one row. Unlike many other databases in which only scalar values can appear in <code>select</code> clauses, PostgreSQL allows set-returning functions to appear in <code>select</code>. One of the most famous generator functions is the <code>generate_series</code> functions which accepts <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>step (optional)</code> parameters, and generates a series of values from start to stop with a step size. This function can generate different types of series including <code>integer</code>, <code>bigint</code>, <code>numeric</code>, and even <code>timestamp</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code

Physical joins represent the actual join operations that the database performs to join your data. These include Nested Loop Join, Hash Join, and Merge Join. You can use <code>explain</code> functionality to see which kind of physical join your database is using in the plan to execute the logical join you have defined in your SQL.</p>\n<p>ZigZag join is a physical join strategy, and can be thought of as a more performant nested loop join. Assume we have a table like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">create</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">table</span> vehicle<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>id <span class=\"token keyword\">integer</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">primary</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">key</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> tires <span class=\"token keyword\">integer</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> wings <span class=\"token keyword\">integer</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">create</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">index</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">on</span> vehicle<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>tires<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">create</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">index</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">on</span> vehicle<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>wings<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we have a <code>select</code> query like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> vehicle <span class=\"token keyword\">where</span> tires <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span> <span class=\"token operator\">and</span> wings <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Normally this would be a tough task for a database without a Zig-Zag join, because using one of the secondary indexes and the primary index in our join plan, we still need to fetch many records if we're having such a situation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there are many vehicles with tires = 0, or wings = 1</li>\n<li>but not many vehicles with both tires = 0 and wings = 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ZigZag join can make use of both indexes to reduce the number of fetched records:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/static/images/posts/postgres-meme/zigzag.svg\" alt=\"Zig Zag Join\"></p>\n<p>In the zig-zag join shown in the image above, we continually switch between the secondary indexes while comparing with the primary index:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We first look at the tires index for values of <code>tires = 0</code>. The first <code>id</code> is equal to <code>1</code>. Therefore, we need to jump (zig) to the other index and look for rows where <code>id = 1 (match)</code> or <code>id > 1 (skip)</code>. So in general, we jump to the row where <code>id >= 1</code>.</li>\n<li>Zig to the wings index, and as <code>id = 1</code>, we have found a match.

In this level, we'll delve into the depths of PostgreSQL. Prepare to navigate the challenges and professional topics of a modern database system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"denormalization\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#denormalization\"></a>Denormalization<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#denormalization\"></a></h3>\n<p>One of the first steps of designing a database application is going thorough the normalization process (1NF, 2NF, ...) in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. Even though relational database, specially Postgres, are well optimized for having many primary keys and foreign keys in tables, and are capable of joining between many tables and handling many constraints, a heavily normalized schema might still be challenging to deal with because of performance penalties.</p>\n<p>In such a scenario, if maintaining a fully normalized table becomes challenging, the database designer can go thorough a process known as <em>denormalization</em>. In other words, it improves the read performance of your data, with the cost of reducing the write performance, as you may need to write multiple copies of your data.</p>\n<p>PostgreSQL natively supports many denormalized data types including <code>array</code>, composite types created via <code>create type</code>, <code>enum</code>, <code>xml</code>, and <code>json</code> types. Materialized views are also used to implement faster reads with slower writes trade-off. A materialized view is a view that is stored on disk. You can create a denormalized and materialized view of your data for fast reads, and then use <code>refresh materialized view my_view</code> to refresh this cache.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nulls-in-check-constraints-are-truthy\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#nulls-in-check-constraints-are-truthy\"></a><code>NULL</code>s in <code>CHECK</code> constraints are truthy<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#nulls-in-check-constraints-are-truthy\"></a></h3>\n<p>As we have mentioned earlier, <code>null</code> in SQL means not knowing the value, rather than the absence of a value, and such a select will return <code>null</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">null</span> <span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">-- null</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we create a column with a check constraint on it like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">create</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">table</span> mature_person<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>id <span class=\"token keyword\">integer</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">primary</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">key</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> age <span class=\"token keyword\">integer</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">check</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>age <span class=\"token operator\">>=</span> <span class=\"token number\">18</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>and then we try to insert a row where the <code>age</code> equals 15, we will get this error:</p>\n<pre><code>ERROR:  new row for relation \"mature_person\" violates check constraint \"mature_person_age_check\"\nDETAIL:  Failing row contains (1, 15).\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, this <code>insert</code> will succeed:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">insert</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">into</span> mature_person<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>id<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> age<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">values</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">null</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">-- INSERT 0 1</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">-- Query returned successfully in 80 msec.</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's might not make sense to assume something satisfies a check constraint when you don't know the value of it (<code>null</code>), but in SQL we have to let the row thorough because <code>null</code>s in <code>check</code> constraints are truthy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"transaction-contention\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#transaction-contention\"></a>Transaction Contention<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#transaction-contention\"></a></h3>\n<p>Resource contention is a conflict over access to a shared resource like RAM, network interface, storage, etc. In case of SQL databases, a resource contention can appear in form of transaction contentions, and that is when multiple transactions want to write to a row at the same time. A transaction contention might require delays, retries, or halts to fix as they might cause deadlocks/livelocks. This is actually configurable using the <code>deadlock_timeout</code> config.</p>\n<p>A contention usually slows down your database without leaving many clues for you to debug them, and the negative effect gets worse when you have multiple nodes or clusters. That being said, tools like Postgres-BDR might provides tools to diagnose and correct contention problems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"select-for-update\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#select-for-update\"></a><code>SELECT FOR UPDATE</code><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#select-for-update\"></a></h3>\n<p><code>select</code> clause is used to read data from database, but sometimes you want to select rows in order to write them.

TPC-C involves a mix of five concurrent transactions of different types and complexity either executed on-line or queued for deferred execution. The database is comprised of nine types of tables with a wide range of record and population sizes. TPC-C is measured in transactions per minute (tpmC).</p>\n<p>TPC-C benchmarks includes two type of wait times: The keying time represents the time spent entering data at the terminal (pressing keys on the keyboard) and the think time represents the time spent, by the operator, to read the result of the transaction at the terminal before requesting another transaction. Each transaction has a minimum keying time and a minimum think time.</p>\n<p>These times will help the benchmark to be closer to real-world scenarios. Benchmarking transactions without wait-time will make the system under test slower and slower overtime as the system internals will have no free resources to operate.</p>\n<p><code>pgbench</code> is the command-line tool used to benchmark PostgreSQL databases, and it supports TPC and many different command-line arguments including wait-time/schedule-lag-time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"deferrable-initially-immediate\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#deferrable-initially-immediate\"></a>DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#deferrable-initially-immediate\"></a></h3>\n<p>Constraints on columns can be either <code>deferred</code> or <code>immediate</code>.

Finding the best join order is an NP-hard problem. This is why database engines use estimates, statistics, and soft computing approaches to find an order since finding the optimal solution would take forever.</p>\n<p>This is a simplified table of problem classes:</p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>Problem Class</th><th>Verify Solution</th><th>Find Solution</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>P</td><td>😁 Easy</td><td>😁 Easy</td><td>Multiply numbers</td></tr><tr><td>NP</td><td>😁 Easy</td><td>😥 Hard</td><td>8 Queens</td></tr><tr><td>NP-hard</td><td>😥 Hard</td><td>😭 Hard</td><td>Best next move in Chess</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<p>NP-hard problems are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP.

The query pipeline optimizers are used to massage the query plans to crack and to propagate this information. The technique allows for improved access times and self-organized behavior.</p>\n<p>In other words, Database cracking is an approach for data indexing and index maintainance in a self-organized way. In a database system where database cracking is used, an incoming query requesting all elements which satisfy a certain condition <code>c</code> does not only return a result but it also causes a reodering of the physical database so that all elements satisfying <code>c</code> are stored in a contiguous memery space. Therefore the physical database is devided into multiple parts (cracked).</p>\n<p>By using this mechanism the database reorganizes itself in the most favourable way according to the workload which is put on it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/static/images/posts/postgres-meme/database-cracking.svg\" alt=\"SIMD\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read more: <a href=\"https://db.in.tum.de/teaching/ws1718/seminarHauptspeicherdbs/paper/werner.pdf\">Database Cracking by David Werner</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"wcoj\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#wcoj\"></a>WCOJ<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#wcoj\"></a></h3>\n<p>Traditional <em>binary join</em> algorithms such as hash join operate over two relations at a time (<code>r1 join r2</code>); joins between more than two relations are implemented by repeatedly applying binary joins (<code>r1 join (r2 join r3)</code>).</p>\n<p>WCOJ (Worst-Case Optimal Join) is a kind of join algorithm whose running time is worst-case optimal for all natural join queries, and is asymptotically faster in worst case than any join algorithm based on such iterated binary joins.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read more: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.1952.pdf\">Worst-case Optimal Join Algorithms</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"learned-indexes\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#learned-indexes\"></a>Learned Indexes<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#learned-indexes\"></a></h3>\n<p>Learned Indexes are indexing strategies that utilize artificial intelligence approaches and deep-learning models to outperform cache-optimized B-Trees and reduce memory usage.

But since transaction IDs have limited size (32 bits) a cluster that runs for a long time (more than 4 billion transactions) would suffer transaction ID wraparound: the XID counter wraps around to zero, and all of a sudden transactions that were in the past appear to be in the future — which means their output become invisible. In short, catastrophic data loss. (Actually the data is still there, but that's cold comfort if you cannot get at it.)</p>\n<p>To avoid this, it is necessary to vacuum every table in every database at least once every two billion transactions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html#VACUUM-FOR-WRAPAROUND\">Routine Vacuuming: Preventing Transaction ID Wraparound Failures</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"level-7-pitch-black-zone\"><a href=\"https://avestura.dev/blog/explaining-the-postgres-meme#level-7-pitch-black-zone\"></a>Level 7: Pitch Black Zone<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#level-7-pitch-black-zone\"></a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"/data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27904%27%20height=%27153%27/%3e\"><img src=\"/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fposts%2Fpostgres-meme%2Flevels%2Fpitch-black.jpg&#x26;w=1920&#x26;q=75\" alt=\"The Legendary Postgres meme\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fposts%2Fpostgres-meme%2Flevels%2Fpitch-black.jpg&#x26;w=1920&#x26;q=75\" alt=\"The Legendary Postgres meme\"></p>\n<p>Welcome to Pitch Black Zone!
