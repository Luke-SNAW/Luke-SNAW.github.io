chondrocytes.</li>\n<li>Chondrocytes produce extracellular cartilage matrix and collagen fibers, providing shock absorption and smooth joint gliding.</li>\n<li>Exercise and activity positively (anabolic) or negatively (catabolic) influence cartilage matrix and collagen production.</li>\n<li>Cartilage is best strengthened by short bouts (10-15 minutes) of cyclic, non-impact or soft-impact exercise of moderate intensity and resistance.</li>\n<li>Sufficiently long rest periods (4-8 hours, depending on cartilage health) are crucial between exercise sessions.</li>\n<li>Cyclic, repetitive gliding motion stimulates cartilage cells to produce matrix and collagen, especially when combined with moderate actual pressure.</li>\n<li>Ideal exercises include stationary cycling, cross-trainers, rowing machines, and leg press machines, performed for 10-15 minutes with moderate resistance and adequate rest.</li>\n<li>Sudden spikes of load, like in running or jumping, are not ideal for cartilage itself but can strengthen the subchondral bone plate.</li>\n<li>Strengthening the subchondral bone plate can protect deeper bone and potentially allow a return to impact sports over time, but requires a very gradual progression.</li>\n<li>Supplements like glucosamine, AKBA, undenatured collagen type 2, collagen hydrolysate, and bromelain may support cartilage health by reinforcing anabolic mechanisms or decreasing catabolic pathways.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Children</strong>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/6xt2ox13lqjmizhzgya8i3e\">Dust</a></li>\n<li><a
