not keen on writing specifications in gherkin (Given/When/Then) as I think it’s too generic and frequently makes the feature specifications too verbose – and takes emphasis away from the critical parts.</p>\n<p>The important thing to note is <strong>the actual documentation artifact generated isn’t as important as the collaborative process that is involved in generating it.</strong> This is often about asking the right questions and adding more examples until there’s nothing that is unclear.</p>\n<p>The document isn’t a template – the actual documentation varies based on conversation, problem and context.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"example-royalty-payment-splits\">Example: Royalty Payment Splits<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\"
