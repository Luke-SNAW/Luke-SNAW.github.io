Every time I write some rust I feel limited. I always have to search libraries and how to do things. I cannot just \"type the code\".</p>\n<p>Also the type system can get out of control, it can be very hard to actually know what method you can call on a struct.</p>\n<p>I still think rust is a great tool, and that it solves tons of problem.
