People should be able to reduce the chances they end up in a situation like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carnage4life/status/1532472869334110208\">this</a>, or <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/twitter-rescinds-job-offer-to-new-hire/\">this</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Disclaimer: These questions are direct, but a company that reacts badly to them may not be a good place to work.

In this case, figure out if they will get to a yes. Unless you want to join a sinking ship, of course!</p>\n<p>Early stage founders are (or should be) super-mega-extra-desperately keen to have product-market fit – it's all that really matters. The ones that will succeed are those that are honest about this (or those that have it already) and are prioritizing it. Many will think or say (intentionally or through self-delusion) that they have it when they don't.</p>\n<p>Low user or revenue numbers and vague answers to the example questions above are a sign that it isn't there. Product-market fit <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/library/5z-the-real-product-market-fit\">is <em>very</em> obvious</a>.</p>\n<p>Avoid:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Founders who aren't spending a ton of time talking and selling to users pre-product-market fit – it's a flag to attempt to outsource/delegate this</li>\n<li>Companies where you don't understand the product or its benefits – if it can't be explained to you, others will struggle</li>\n<li>Solutions looking for a problem</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there is no product-market fit, but you think the team could find it, it's very important the company has lots of runway (it'll be hard to raise more money without product-market fit, so time to find it is crucial), doesn't have a huge team (it's harder to make rapid changes in direction with a lot of people), and moves fast (look out for bureaucracy, management, or a team that can't work well with ambiguity).</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-much-runway-does-the-company-have-does-their-spending-look-within-reason\"><a href=\"https://posthog.com/blog/what-to-ask-in-interviews#how-much-runway-does-the-company-have-does-their-spending-look-within-reason\"></a>How much runway does the company have?
