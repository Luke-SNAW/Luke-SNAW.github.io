(I'll admit it took me a few years before I knew what h1-h6 headings were for, so it happens.) The mighty button is actually really cool. It can do all these things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Receive keyboard focus by default</li>\n<li>\"Click\" with the Space key</li>\n<li>Submit form data to a server</li>\n<li>Reset a form</li>\n<li>Be disabled with the disabledattribute</li>\n<li>Instruct a screen reader with the implicit buttonrole</li>\n<li>Show :focus, :hover, :active, :disabled</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With a little scripting, a button is the perfect element for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opening a modal window</li>\n<li>Triggering a popup menu</li>\n<li>Toggling an interface</li>\n<li>Playing media content</li>\n<li>Inserting with JS if they only work with JS</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"links\">Links<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#links\"></a></h2>\n<p>Here are a few of the basic features of links, a.k.a. anchors, a.k.a. the foundation of the Web:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create hypertext, a network of online resources</li>\n<li>Navigate the user to a new page or view</li>\n<li>Change the URL</li>\n<li>Cause a browser redraw/refresh</li>\n<li>Support page jumps with internal hrefattributes</li>\n<li>Deep-link client-rendered applications</li>\n<li>Are focusable by default with the hrefattribute</li>\n<li>Register a click with the Enter key</li>\n<li>Have the implicit linkrole</li>\n<li>Can't be disabled like buttons but can be made inert with tabindex=\"-1\"and aria-hidden=\"true\"</li>\n<li>Allow opening in new windows (and back in the day, framesets)</li>\n<li>Show :link, :visited, :focus, :hover, :active</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The starkest difference between a link and a button to me is that a link navigates the user to a new resource, taking them away from the current context (internal links are the only wrinkle here). A button toggles something in the interface, like a video player; or triggers new content in that same context, like a popup menu using <strong>aria-haspopup</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-navigation-what-is-routing\">What is navigation?
