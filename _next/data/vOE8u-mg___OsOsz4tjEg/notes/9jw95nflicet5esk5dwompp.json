My personal projects live in a <code>~/sources</code> directory. All my work projects live in <code>~/work</code>. This is the first level.</p>\n<p>Level 2 is the client, e.g. <code>~/work/client1</code>. Naturally, level 3 is the project repository: <code>~/work/client1/foo-api</code>.</p>\n<p>This is how my work directory is organized:</p>\n<pre><code>/Users/garrit/work\n├── client1\n│   ├── foo-api\n│   ├── foo-ios\n│   └── foo-android\n└── client2\n    ├── bar-ios\n    └── bar-middleware\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, say that <code>client2</code> demands that we commit with a different identity than our default work email. Besides that, you probably also have a personal email address for your own projects. How do you manage that?</p>\n<h2 id=\"gitconfig-includes\">.gitconfig includes<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#gitconfig-includes\"></a></h2>\n<p>The global configuration file for Git is <code>~/.gitconfig</code>. If you've ever set a parameter like <code>git config user.name \"Foo Bar\"</code>: this is where it ended up.</p>\n<p>One awesome feature of the .gitconfig file is that you can <strong>conditionally include other config files</strong>, and this is what does the trick. Here's my <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-ini\"><code class=\"language-ini\"><span class=\"token header\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token section-name selector\">user</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></span>\n    <span class=\"token key attr-name\">name</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> <span class=\"token value attr-value\">Garrit Franke</span>\n    <span class=\"token key attr-name\">email</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> <span class=\"token value attr-value\">garrit@slashdev.space</span>\n\n<span class=\"token header\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token section-name selector\">includeIf \"gitdir:~/work/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></span>\n    <span class=\"token key attr-name\">path</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> <span class=\"token value attr-value\">~/.gitconfig-work</span>\n\n<span class=\"token header\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token section-name selector\">includeIf \"gitdir:~/work/client2/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></span>\n    <span class=\"token key attr-name\">path</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> <span class=\"token value attr-value\">~/.gitconfig-client2</span>\n\n<span class=\"token header\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token section-name selector\">includeIf \"gitdir:~/sources/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></span>\n    <span class=\"token key attr-name\">path</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> <span class=\"token value attr-value\">~/.gitconfig-personal</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># ...</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>By default, my name and email are always set to my personal identity. I also store some other global settings here, but those are not relevant for this post. If the repository is located inside the <code>~/work</code> directory, a file named <code>~/.gitconfig-work</code> is included. This is just another gitconfig file. This is what that looks like in my case:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-ini\"><code class=\"language-ini\"><span class=\"token header\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token section-name selector\">user</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></span>\n    <span class=\"token key attr-name\">name</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> <span class=\"token value attr-value\">Garrit Franke</span>\n    <span class=\"token key attr-name\">signingkey</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> <span class=\"token value attr-value\">12345678</span>\n    <span class=\"token key attr-name\">email</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> <span class=\"token value attr-value\">garrit@work.de</span>\n\n<span class=\"token header\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token section-name selector\">commit</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></span>\n    <span class=\"token key attr-name\">gpgsign</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> <span class=\"token value attr-value\">true</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>I hope you'll see where this is going. For every identity, you keep a separate gitconfig file and include it in the main <code>~/.gitconfig</code>. Crucially, this requires you to organize your repositories grouped by client.</p>\n<p>This trick has simplified my project onboarding quite a bit. No more \"You forgot to update your Email Address\" requests from clients!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37904125\">You can also filter based on the remote URL!</a></p>\n<pre class=\"language-ini\"><code class=\"language-ini\"><span class=\"token comment\">; include only if a remote with the given URL exists (note</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">; that such a URL may be provided later in a file or in a</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">; file read after this file is read, as seen in this example)</span>\n<span class=\"token header\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token section-name selector\">includeIf \"hasconfig:remote.*.url:https://example.com/\\*\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></span>\n    <span class=\"token key attr-name\">path</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> <span class=\"token value attr-value\">foo.inc</span>\n<span class=\"token header\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token section-name selector\">remote \"origin\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></span>\n    <span class=\"token key attr-name\">url</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> <span class=\"token value attr-value\">https://example.com/git*</span>\n</code></pre>","noteIndex":{"id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","title":"Luke","desc":"","updated":1761796791487,"created":1644449449778,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"4e745570ca97988a0362cb939b760952","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"life-tips","position":{"start":{"line":41,"column":5,"offset":2603},"end":{"line":41,"column":29,"offset":2627},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"life-tips","anchorHeader":"wodenokoto"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2025","alias":"What I read in 2025","position":{"start":{"line":70,"column":3,"offset":4333},"end":{"line":70,"column":54,"offset":4384},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2025"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2024","alias":"2024","position":{"start":{"line":71,"column":5,"offset":4389},"end":{"line":71,"column":41,"offset":4425},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2024"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2023","alias":"2023","position":{"start":{"line":72,"column":5,"offset":4430},"end":{"line":72,"column":41,"offset":4466},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2023"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2022","alias":"2022","position":{"start":{"line":73,"column":5,"offset":4471},"end":{"line":73,"column":41,"offset":4507},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2022"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-struggled-brag-in","position":{"start":{"line":79,"column":3,"offset":4643},"end":{"line":79,"column":39,"offset":4679},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-struggled-brag-in"}}],"anchors":{"what-i-read-in-past":{"type":"header","text":"What I read in past","value":"what-i-read-in-past","line":74,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["zd4mq442jike0pr0wba1u3m","6hzeqsofq67gdk88flxlkhp","778ijii93yu5uwnrwmn5zi4","g1fngdjl25nes6fs3lip602","ZbdkdApFqLdks4Moq92R9","uoc5hhki3o4py15cesddu8q","9qf7j06jtdkm6rnx9ymvwb0","5zn10cvj7ajy2gh2is5nqmg","4qo9ma0z0yu1czns6pxl7y5","ok0e729ho7o09xetujkxc0m","GR5x8HnNFEN6fU2UBSEIK","yirtnlj8q24yutcf3ss1xqy","eq0wc6t7wl2wv221yb68ro4","7x2fnv4j6gxts08qk0jguny","ettkt3iClONnxpbGwBVLl","7l4knev6v613tbuoskvmbdg","hvh5bud6yp7dc89tuh95tr9","4fvoqrplw0cweo554usbjos","f8qsfql0a9v8thpeo82udfa","1swsbrhqi9jk41v9eodyi5q","SQqYupi6EFddTerBA8RRD","hjNeNc1F2JUh0lTWanH4h","qf0l4wbrc9jgooyzexmbq5v","uur1lkol353z9vfeqb3n5bv","cd9n1czq3ursgkby985wkmm","k1sr43vwnfqztwc0s43pkcf","wfde75rhdvq2yfa2zy2q6rv","rjcmdv60jokmbw6zoq8u2ef","ujapvww8o6v3kpmlhtryq4k","pkwewou9d5e8ystswn1j2b4"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nHi there 👋.
