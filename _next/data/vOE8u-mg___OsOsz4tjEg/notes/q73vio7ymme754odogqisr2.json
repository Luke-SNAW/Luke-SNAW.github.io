It started as a side-project 5 years ago, but I've recently gone full time on it.\nIt actually started as a Mac app 10 years ago and I choose to create a solitaire game because I had made a string of side-project that I didn't earn any money on, so I wanted to see if I could find a project that would actually generate some side-income.</p>\n<p>I did it by scraping the Mac App Store so I could find apps that had a lot of downloads and bad reviews. I figured that if an app had a lot of downloads, but got bad reviews then I could create something better and there would be an audience for it. The app ended up making enough money that I've kept it as a side-hustle for all these years. I've written about how I picked the app here: <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-i-grew-a-simple-solitaire-game-to-10k-mrr-28e352c308\">https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-i-grew-a-simple-solitaire-game-to-10k-mrr-28e352c308</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"footnotes\">Footnotes<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#footnotes\"></a></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span id=\"fn-1\" style=\"width: 0; height: 0;\"></span><p>People often think of 'niching down' as adding features, but I would argue it is often just as much about removing features.
