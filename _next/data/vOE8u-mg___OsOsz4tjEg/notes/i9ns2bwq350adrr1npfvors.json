However, there are cases in which we may find some of the benefits of GraphQL more important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re using GraphQL <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/\">federation</a> or schema stitching to create a supergraph of all our business data and decide to have GraphQL subgraphs published by each service. We create two supergraph endpoints: one external to be called by clients and one internal to be called by services. In this case, it may not be worth it for services to also expose a gRPC API, because they can all be conveniently reached through the supergraph.</li>\n<li>We know our services’ data fields are going to be changing and want field-level visibility on usage so that we can remove old deprecated fields (and aren’t stuck with maintaining them forever).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>There’s also the question of whether we should be doing server-to-server communication ourselves at all. For data fetching (GraphQL’s queries), it’s the fastest way to get a response, but for modifying data (mutations), things like Martin Fowler’s “synchronous calls considered harmful” (see <a href=\"https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html?ref=wellarchitected#SynchronousCallsConsideredHarmful\">sidebar here</a>) have led to using async, event-driven architecture with either choreography or orchestration between services. <a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/microservices-patterns\">Microservices Patterns</a> recommends using the latter in most cases, and to maintain DX and development speed, we need a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lSuDRRFgyY\">code-based orchestrator</a> instead of a DSL-based one. And once we’re working in a code-based orchestrator like Temporal, we no longer make network requests ourselves—the platform reliably handles it for us. In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lorendsr/status/1419880024929415173\">my opinion</a>, that’s the future.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"client-server\">Client-server<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#client-server\"></a></h3>\n<p>In client-server communication, latency is high. We want to be able to get all the data we need in a single round trip, have flexibility in what data we fetch for different views, and have powerful caching, so GraphQL is the clear winner. However, there are cases in which we may choose to use gRPC instead:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We already have a gRPC API that can be used, and the cost of adding a GraphQL server in front of that isn’t worth the benefits.</li>\n<li>JSON is not a good fit for the data (e.g. we’re sending a significant amount of binary data).</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","title":"Luke","desc":"","updated":1761796791487,"created":1644449449778,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"4e745570ca97988a0362cb939b760952","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"life-tips","position":{"start":{"line":41,"column":5,"offset":2603},"end":{"line":41,"column":29,"offset":2627},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"life-tips","anchorHeader":"wodenokoto"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2025","alias":"What I read in 2025","position":{"start":{"line":70,"column":3,"offset":4333},"end":{"line":70,"column":54,"offset":4384},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2025"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2024","alias":"2024","position":{"start":{"line":71,"column":5,"offset":4389},"end":{"line":71,"column":41,"offset":4425},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2024"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2023","alias":"2023","position":{"start":{"line":72,"column":5,"offset":4430},"end":{"line":72,"column":41,"offset":4466},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2023"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2022","alias":"2022","position":{"start":{"line":73,"column":5,"offset":4471},"end":{"line":73,"column":41,"offset":4507},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2022"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-struggled-brag-in","position":{"start":{"line":79,"column":3,"offset":4643},"end":{"line":79,"column":39,"offset":4679},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-struggled-brag-in"}}],"anchors":{"what-i-read-in-past":{"type":"header","text":"What I read in past","value":"what-i-read-in-past","line":74,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["zd4mq442jike0pr0wba1u3m","6hzeqsofq67gdk88flxlkhp","778ijii93yu5uwnrwmn5zi4","g1fngdjl25nes6fs3lip602","ZbdkdApFqLdks4Moq92R9","uoc5hhki3o4py15cesddu8q","9qf7j06jtdkm6rnx9ymvwb0","5zn10cvj7ajy2gh2is5nqmg","4qo9ma0z0yu1czns6pxl7y5","ok0e729ho7o09xetujkxc0m","GR5x8HnNFEN6fU2UBSEIK","yirtnlj8q24yutcf3ss1xqy","eq0wc6t7wl2wv221yb68ro4","7x2fnv4j6gxts08qk0jguny","ettkt3iClONnxpbGwBVLl","7l4knev6v613tbuoskvmbdg","hvh5bud6yp7dc89tuh95tr9","4fvoqrplw0cweo554usbjos","f8qsfql0a9v8thpeo82udfa","1swsbrhqi9jk41v9eodyi5q","SQqYupi6EFddTerBA8RRD","hjNeNc1F2JUh0lTWanH4h","qf0l4wbrc9jgooyzexmbq5v","uur1lkol353z9vfeqb3n5bv","cd9n1czq3ursgkby985wkmm","k1sr43vwnfqztwc0s43pkcf","wfde75rhdvq2yfa2zy2q6rv","rjcmdv60jokmbw6zoq8u2ef","ujapvww8o6v3kpmlhtryq4k","pkwewou9d5e8ystswn1j2b4"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nHi there 👋.
