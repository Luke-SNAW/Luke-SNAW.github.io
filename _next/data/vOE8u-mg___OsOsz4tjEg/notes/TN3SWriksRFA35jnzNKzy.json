That Supabase is betting on <a href=\"https://deno.com/deploy\">Deno</a> for their <a href=\"https://deno.com/blog/supabase-functions-on-deno-deploy\">serverless function suite</a> indicates to us that they are serious about great technology.</p>\n<p>We love <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a> which Supabase utilizes. We plan to do more research on scalability, since SQL databases can‚Äôt grow as big as their NoSQL counterparts.

The economics of developer tooling are a super-power-law. So, if you hope to pay your employees you'll need to grow with your biggest customers.</p>\n<p>Eventually, as they become TheNextBigThing, your biggest customers end up wanting the bells and whistles that only a Big Cloud Platform provide.</p>\n<p>This was a part of the reason we chose to join Google, and why the Firebase team really really really pushed hard to integrate with GCP at a project, billing, and product level (philosophy: Firebase exposed the product from the client, GCP from the server) despite all the organizational/political overhead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I'm excited to see the current crop of app platforms emerge.
