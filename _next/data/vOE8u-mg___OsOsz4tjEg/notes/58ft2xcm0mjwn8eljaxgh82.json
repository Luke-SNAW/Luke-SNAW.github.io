use.\"</li>\n<li>\"JWTokens are stateless, so you don't use memory on the server.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am sure their intentions are good, but they share an un-secure way of authenticating and authorizing users, at least for web applications.</p>\n<p>However, please don't feel bad; I used JWT (incorrectly) when starting I was starting out because I didn't know any better.</p>\n<h2

href=\"#the-way-jwt-is-usually-implemented-in-tutorials\"></a></h2>\n<p>With that out of the way, let's go through the flow to authenticate users with JWT.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The user enters their username and password —</strong> When the user clicks the sign-in button, a request is sent to the server to verify the user's credential with the database.</li>\n<li><strong>The server successfully authenticates the user</strong> — The server now creates and signs a JWT using a secret password and returns it in the response.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tutorials usually set the expiration to about one week to 30 days.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Client Receives the JWT in the response</strong> — The developer (in a client like chrome) receives it, applies some logic, and then stores it, usually in Local Storage.</li>\n<li><strong>The Client uses info stored in the Token to render conditionally</strong> — Usually, tutorials use fields like a user's email, username, and boolean fields like <code>isAdmin</code><strong>.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The Client Adds the Token as a header for every request</strong> — If the Token exists in Local Storage, the user's session is active.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The server can now check the user's identity by decrypting the signed Token on every request.</p>\n<p>The Token will be valid until it expires.</p>\n<h2
