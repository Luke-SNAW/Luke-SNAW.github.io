But the real difference that companies are looking for is not that you are capable, but that you have demonstrated those capabilities by delivering impact. It’s not enough to have the skills, you have to deploy them to produce something of value to the wider group. In fact, while companies may put language about increasing expertise in their engineering levels, the real lens that they use to evaluate that expertise is through increasing scope of ownership, delivery, and impact.</p>\n<h2 id=\"true-seniority-in-software-careers\"><a href=\"https://betterprogramming.pub/true-seniority-67b2e01cce81\">True Seniority in Software Careers</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#true-seniority-in-software-careers\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3VLuU0c\">Tribal Leadership</a> is a model that describes company culture in five stages, a rough overview:</p>\n<h3 id=\"stage-1\"><strong>Stage 1</strong><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#stage-1\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Theme</strong>: “Life sucks”</li>\n<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: “Alienated”</li>\n<li><strong>Behaviour</strong>: “Desparingly hostile”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"stage-2\">Stage 2<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#stage-2\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Theme</strong>: “My life sucks”</li>\n<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: “Separate”</li>\n<li><strong>Behaviour:</strong> “Apathetic victims”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"stage-3\">Stage 3<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#stage-3\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Theme</strong>: “I am great (and you are not)”</li>\n<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: “Personal superiority”</li>\n<li><strong>Behaviour:</strong> “Lone Warrior”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"stage-4\">Stage 4<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#stage-4\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Theme</strong>: “We are great”</li>\n<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: “Stable partnership”</li>\n<li><strong>Behaviour:</strong> “Tribal pride”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"stage-5\">Stage 5<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#stage-5\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Theme</strong>: “Life is great”</li>\n<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: “Teams”</li>\n<li><strong>Behaviour</strong>: “Innocent Wonderment”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The important part for getting into gaining impact is between Stage 3 and Stage 4.
