As part of that work, we recently introduced a new <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/policies#browsers\">secure browser policy</a> prohibiting Google OAuth requests in embedded browser libraries commonly referred to as embedded webviews. All embedded webviews will be blocked starting on <strong>September 30, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>Embedded webview libraries are problematic because they allow a nefarious developer to intercept and alter communications between Google and its users by acting as a \"<a href=\"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\">man in the middle</a>.\" An application embedding a webview can modify or intercept network requests, insert custom scripts that can potentially record every keystroke entered in a login form, access session cookies, or alter the content of the webpage. These libraries also allow the removal of key elements of a browser that hold user trust, such as the guarantee that the response originates from Google's servers, display of the website domain, and the ability to inspect the security of a connection. Additionally the <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252#section-8.12\">OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps</a> guidelines from IETF require that native apps must not use embedded user-agents such as webviews to perform authorization requests.</p>\n<p>Embedded webviews not only affect account security, they could affect usability of your application. The sandboxed storage environment of an embedded webview disconnects a user from the single sign-on features they expect from Google. A full-featured web browser supports multiple tools to help a logged-out user quickly sign-in to their account including password managers and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API\">Web Authentication</a> libraries. Google's users also expect multiple-step login processes, including <a href=\"https://www.google.com/landing/2step/\">two-step verification</a> and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/families/answer/9204736\">child account authorizations</a>, to function seamlessly when a login flow involves multiple devices, when switching to another app on the device, or when communicating with peripherals such as a security key.</p>\n<h3 id=\"instructions-for-impacted-developers\"><a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/upcoming-security-changes-to-googles-oauth-2.0-authorization-endpoint.html#instructions\">Instructions for impacted developers</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#instructions-for-impacted-developers\"></a></h3>\n<p>Developers must register an appropriate OAuth client for each platform (Desktop, Android, iOS, etc.) on which your app will run, in compliance with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/policies#register\">Google's OAuth 2.0 Policies</a>. You can verify the OAuth client ID used by your installed application is the most appropriate choice for your platform by visiting the Google API Console's <a href=\"https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials\">Credentials page</a>. A \"Web application\" client type in use by an Android application is an example of mismatched use. Reference our <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app\">OAuth 2.0 for Mobile &#x26; Desktop Apps</a> guide to properly integrate the appropriate client for your app's platform.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"action-advised-take-action-to-continue-using-googles-oauth-authorization-endpoint\">[Action Advised] Take action to continue using Google's OAuth authorization

href=\"#what-do-you-need-to-know\"></a></h3>\n<p>Embedded webview libraries are highly customizable, which can expose Google's login and account authorization pages to potential \"man-in-the-middle\" attacks. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/policies#browsers\">Google's OAuth 2.0 \"Use secure browsers\" policy</a> helps us protect users from these and other types of attacks.</p>\n<p>Examples of affected embedded webview libraries include android.webkit.WebView on Android and WKWebView on iOS or
