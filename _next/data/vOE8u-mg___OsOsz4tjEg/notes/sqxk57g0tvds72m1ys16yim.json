conflated, as they work together to manage cross-origin resource access.</li>\n<li>CORS was developed as a workaround for security vulnerabilities but is fundamentally flawed, as it does not adequately prevent cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks.</li>\n<li>Implicit credentials in web browsers can lead to security risks, allowing malicious sites to make unauthorized requests using a user's credentials (e.g., cookies).</li>\n<li>The default CORS policy allows requests but prevents reading results, which does not fully protect against certain types of attacks, such as unauthorized fund transfers.</li>\n<li>The recommended approach to secure applications is to ignore implicit credentials for cross-origin requests and only allow explicit credentials through controlled exceptions.</li>\n<li>Utilizing explicit credentials, such as API tokens or OAuth tokens in the Authorization header, can effectively mitigate XSRF risks and support multi-account functionality.</li>\n<li>Setting the SameSite attribute on cookies to 'Lax' or 'Strict' can help prevent cookies from being sent with cross-origin requests, enhancing security.</li>\n<li>A simple CORS policy allowing anonymous requests can protect against unauthorized access while still permitting necessary functionality.</li>\n<li>Developers should be cautious about creating overly specific CORS policies, as they may inadvertently introduce new vulnerabilities or hinder legitimate use cases.</li>\n<li>The web's security model is hindered by legacy decisions, but there are ongoing efforts by browser developers to enhance user privacy and security, albeit in an uncoordinated manner.</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","title":"Luke","desc":"","updated":1761796791487,"created":1644449449778,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"4e745570ca97988a0362cb939b760952","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"life-tips","position":{"start":{"line":41,"column":5,"offset":2603},"end":{"line":41,"column":29,"offset":2627},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"life-tips","anchorHeader":"wodenokoto"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2025","alias":"What
