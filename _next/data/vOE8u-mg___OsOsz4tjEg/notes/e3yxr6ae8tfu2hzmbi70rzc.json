This simple approach has allowed them to scale to their size while engineers focus on delivering value to users. Despite the effectiveness of simple architectures, most conferences focus on complex architectures. Wave keeps its architecture simple by using synchronous Python, farming out long tasks, and carefully managing database transactions. They also discuss some initial choices like RabbitMQ and Celery that they now question, but feel Python and GraphQL still make sense for their needs despite some downsides.</p>\n<p>An interesting point made is that Wave's simple architecture allows them to spend their complexity budget where it matters most for their business, such as in telecom integrations which are unavoidably complex but critical given their operations in Africa. This strategic focus on complexity has helped them build a large business with relatively few engineers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"from-from-nibly\">from <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39441508\">from-nibly</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#from-from-nibly\"></a></h2>\n<p>This is what I tell engineers. Microservices aren't a performance strategy. They are a POTENTIAL cost saving strategy against performance. And an engineering coordination strategy.<br>\nTheoretically If you have a monolith that can be scaled horizontally there isn't any difference between having 10 replicas of your monolith and having 5 replicas of two microservices with the same codebase. UNLESS you are trying to underscale part of your functionality. You can't underscale part of your app with a monolith. Your pipe has to be big enough for all of it. Generally speaking though if you are talking about 10 replicas of something there's very little money to be saved anywhere.</p>\n<p>Even then though the cost savings only start at large scales. You need to have a minimum of 3 replicas for resiliency. If those 3 replicas are too big for your scale then you are just wasting money.</p>\n<p>The place where I see any real world benefit for most companies is just engineering coordination. With a single repo for a monolith I can make 1 team own that repo and tell them it's their responsibility to keep it clean. In a shared monolith however 0 people own it because everyone owns it and the repo becomes a disaster faster than you can say \"we need enterprise caching\".</p>\n<h2 id=\"towards-modern-development-of-cloud-applications\"><a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3593856.3595909\">Towards Modern Development of Cloud Applications</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#towards-modern-development-of-cloud-applications\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing distributed applications as microservices introduces challenges like increased latency due to network overhead, difficulty reasoning about interactions between versions, and complex application management.</li>\n<li>The proposed solution advocates writing applications as \"logical monoliths\" using components, and letting a runtime handle physical distribution and execution.
