question is not about React going somewhere, some of the alternatives are not ‚Äúslightly better‚Äù rather immensely better, you know that a big company in Brazil is using Svlete for embedded UI for arduino devices not so powerful, performance is a big thing, as devs we want to build the best application possible, we are not business mens looking for turnover, I‚Äôm a React developer myself and work as a freelance on a big React project, and let me tell you, if the project was written in Solid it will be 10x easier to maintain, just because of the app re-rendering all the time due to useEffects() thrown everywhere and non memoized functions, objets‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a complete mess, anyone that think it‚Äôs not big for me it‚Äôs because they didn‚Äôt work on a big project.</p>\n<p>Thus said i might be completely wrong, but for me i found that Svlete, Solid and Qwik are a superior alternatives, especially Solid, they offer you free optimized code without you thinking about anything,
