Over the past few years the so-called “serverless” database has gotten a lot more traction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the most important paragraph in the article. In a world where things like Dynamo/Cassandra or Spanner/Cockroach exist, manually-sharded DB solutions are pretty much entirely obsolete. Spanner exists because Google got so sick of people building and maintaining bespoke solutions for replication and resharding, which would inevitably have their own set of quirks, bugs, consistency gaps, scaling limits, and manual operations required to reshard or rebalance from time to time. When it's part of the database itself, all those problems just... disappear. It's like a single database that just happens to spread itself across multiple machines. It's an actual distributed cloud solution.<br>\nMy current employer uses sharded and replicated Postgres via RDS. Even basic things like deploying schema changes to every shard are an unbelievable pain in the ass, and changing the number of shards on a major database is a high-touch, multi-day operation. After having worked with Spanner in the past, it's like going back to the stone age, like we're only a step above babysitting individual machines in a closet.
