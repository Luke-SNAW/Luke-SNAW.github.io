What is Richardson Maturity Model<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#1-what-is-richardson-maturity-model\"></a></h2>\n<p>Leonard Richardson analyzed a hundred different web service designs and divided these designs into four categories. These categories are based on <strong>how much the web services are <a href=\"https://restfulapi.net/rest-architectural-constraints/\">REST compliant</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>This model of division of REST services to identify their maturity level – is called <strong>Richardson Maturity Model</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/back-end/richardson-maturity-model-0.webp\" alt=\"The levels of maturity according to Richardson’s model\"></p>\n<p>Richardson used three main <strong>factors to decide the maturity of a service</strong>. These factors are</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/\">URI</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://restfulapi.net/http-methods/\">HTTP Methods</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://restfulapi.net/hateoas/\">HATEOAS (Hypermedia)</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The more a service employs these factors – the more mature it shall be considered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-maturity-levels\">2. Maturity Levels<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#2-maturity-levels\"></a></h2>\n<p>In his analysis, Richardson described total 4 maturity levels as given below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/back-end/richardson-maturity-model-1.webp\" alt=\"Richardson Maturity Model\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Level Zero</li>\n<li>Level One</li>\n<li>Level Two</li>\n<li>Level Three</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that Roy Fielding has already made it very clear that <a href=\"http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\">level 3 RMM is a pre-condition of REST</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"21-level-zero\">2.1. Level Zero<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#21-level-zero\"></a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Level zero of maturity does not make use of any of URI, HTTP Methods, and HATEOAS capabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The services at zero maturity level have a single URI and use a single HTTP method (typically POST).</p>\n<p>For example, most SOAP Web Services use a single URI to identify an endpoint, and HTTP POST to transfer SOAP-based payloads, effectively ignoring the rest of the HTTP verbs.</p>\n<p>Similarly, XML-RPC-based services send data as <em>Plain Old XML</em> (POX).</p>\n<p>These are the most primitive ways of building SOA applications with a single POST method endpoint and using XML to communicate between the client and the server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"22-level-one\">2.2. Level One<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#22-level-one\"></a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Level one of maturity <strong>makes use of URIs</strong>, but does not use the HTTP Methods, and HATEOAS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The services at maturity level one employ many URIs but only a single HTTP verb – generally HTTP POST.</p>\n<p>These services will give each resource, available in the system, a unique URI. A unique URI separately identifies one unique resource – and that makes these services better than level zero.</p>\n<h3 id=\"23-level-two\">2.3. Level Two<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#23-level-two\"></a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Level two of maturity <strong>makes use of URIs and HTTP Methods</strong>, but does not use the HATEOAS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The level two services generally host numerous URIs i.e. addressable resources.</p>\n<p>Such services support several of the HTTP verbs on each exposed resource – Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) services. Here the state of resources, typically representing business entities, can be manipulated over the network.</p>\n<p>The designers of the level two services expect people to put some effort into mastering the APIs – generally by reading the supplied documentation.</p>\n<p>Maturity level 2 is the most popular usecase of REST principles, which advocate using different verbs based on the HTTP request methods, while the system can have multiple resources.</p>\n<h3 id=\"24-level-three\">2.4. Level Three<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#24-level-three\"></a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Level three of maturity <strong>makes use of all three, i.e. URIs and HTTP, and HATEOAS</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Level three is the most mature level of Richardson’s model, which encourages <strong>easy discoverability</strong>. This level makes it easy for the responses to be self-descriptive by using HATEOAS.</p>\n<p>Level three services lead the service consumers through a trail of resources, causing application state transitions as a result.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crummy.com/writing/speaking/2008-QCon/act3.html\">Act Three: The Maturity Heuristic</a></p>","noteIndex":{"id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","title":"Luke","desc":"","updated":1761796791487,"created":1644449449778,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"4e745570ca97988a0362cb939b760952","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"life-tips","position":{"start":{"line":41,"column":5,"offset":2603},"end":{"line":41,"column":29,"offset":2627},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"life-tips","anchorHeader":"wodenokoto"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2025","alias":"What I read in 2025","position":{"start":{"line":70,"column":3,"offset":4333},"end":{"line":70,"column":54,"offset":4384},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2025"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2024","alias":"2024","position":{"start":{"line":71,"column":5,"offset":4389},"end":{"line":71,"column":41,"offset":4425},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2024"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2023","alias":"2023","position":{"start":{"line":72,"column":5,"offset":4430},"end":{"line":72,"column":41,"offset":4466},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2023"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2022","alias":"2022","position":{"start":{"line":73,"column":5,"offset":4471},"end":{"line":73,"column":41,"offset":4507},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2022"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-struggled-brag-in","position":{"start":{"line":79,"column":3,"offset":4643},"end":{"line":79,"column":39,"offset":4679},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-struggled-brag-in"}}],"anchors":{"what-i-read-in-past":{"type":"header","text":"What I read in past","value":"what-i-read-in-past","line":74,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["zd4mq442jike0pr0wba1u3m","6hzeqsofq67gdk88flxlkhp","778ijii93yu5uwnrwmn5zi4","g1fngdjl25nes6fs3lip602","ZbdkdApFqLdks4Moq92R9","uoc5hhki3o4py15cesddu8q","9qf7j06jtdkm6rnx9ymvwb0","5zn10cvj7ajy2gh2is5nqmg","4qo9ma0z0yu1czns6pxl7y5","ok0e729ho7o09xetujkxc0m","GR5x8HnNFEN6fU2UBSEIK","yirtnlj8q24yutcf3ss1xqy","eq0wc6t7wl2wv221yb68ro4","7x2fnv4j6gxts08qk0jguny","ettkt3iClONnxpbGwBVLl","7l4knev6v613tbuoskvmbdg","hvh5bud6yp7dc89tuh95tr9","4fvoqrplw0cweo554usbjos","f8qsfql0a9v8thpeo82udfa","1swsbrhqi9jk41v9eodyi5q","SQqYupi6EFddTerBA8RRD","hjNeNc1F2JUh0lTWanH4h","qf0l4wbrc9jgooyzexmbq5v","uur1lkol353z9vfeqb3n5bv","cd9n1czq3ursgkby985wkmm","k1sr43vwnfqztwc0s43pkcf","wfde75rhdvq2yfa2zy2q6rv","rjcmdv60jokmbw6zoq8u2ef","ujapvww8o6v3kpmlhtryq4k","pkwewou9d5e8ystswn1j2b4"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nHi there 👋.
