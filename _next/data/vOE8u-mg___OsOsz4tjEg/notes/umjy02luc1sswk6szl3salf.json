Users would have popular libraries like jQuery already sitting in their browser cache because earlier visited sites requested them.</p>\n<p>This caching behavior was possible because, at the time, the browser's HTTP caches used the asset URL (<code>cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js</code>) as a single cache key. Browsers use cache keys to figure out if and how to cache a resource. If these keys only consist of the resource URL, it allows the reuse of resources across sites and domains.</p>\n<p>All this worked great, but as it is with many great inventions in web technology, <strong>cross-site resource caching enabled new ways to track users across different sites</strong>.</p>\n<p>As an example, let's assume Facebook loads a unique file in their logged-in area (<code>fb-logo-ajgdmaks839‚Äìas.svg</code> ‚Äì I made that file path up); if I would know the file path to such a file, request it on <code>stefanjudis.com</code> and see a rapid response coming from the browser cache, I can almost be sure that the user has logged into Facebook lately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-http-cache-keys-in-google-chrome\"><a href=\"https://www.stefanjudis.com/notes/say-goodbye-to-resource-caching-across-sites-and-domains/#new-http-cache-keys-in-google-chrome\">New HTTP cache keys in Google Chrome</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#new-http-cache-keys-in-google-chrome\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110269\">Webkit (Safari) changed its caching strategy already in 2013</a> to prevent user tracking via the browser cache. Its cache keys are a combination of the requested resource URL and the top-level domain requesting the resource.</p>\n<p><em>‚òùÔ∏è Big thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomayac/status/1317861511784792067?s=20\">Thomas Steiner, who gave input on that matter</a>.</em></p>\n<p>On the bright side, this cache key structure prevents the mentioned tracking possibilities; unfortunately, it leads to duplicated resources in the browser cache.</p>\n<p>And... it hinders third-party resource sharing across the internet.</p>\n<pre><code>Browsers duplicate resources with different keys:\n\ncdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js-amazon.co.uk\ncdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js-www.stefanjudis.com\n</code></pre>\n<p>Starting with v86, Chrome will be using combined cache keys, too. This change means that it's time to say goodbye to third-party resource-sharing across the web. <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/544400/market-share-of-internet-browsers-desktop/\">With Chrome's market share of roughly 70%</a>, most browsers hitting our sites will use partitioned browser caches from now on. Chrome went for combining the top-level site URL, the current frame site URL, and the resource URL. This approach is more granular than what Safari does, but the result is the same.</p>\n<p>If your sites request the global jQuery, modules from <a href=\"https://unpkg.com/\">unpkg.com</a>, font files from <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/\">Google fonts</a> or GA's (Google Analytics) <code>analytics.js</code>, <strong>users will redownload the resources no matter if they downloaded and cached them for other sites already.</strong></p>\n<p>What does this change mean for you? If your sites live on modern hosting that provides a CDN and supports HTTP/2, you should drop the third-parties and ship all resources yourself. Relying on a third party resources offers little value in 2020.</p>\n<p>I have mixed feelings about these changes. It's excellent that browsers consider privacy, but it looks like anything can be misused for tracking purposes these days.
