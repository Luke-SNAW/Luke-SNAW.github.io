People should be able to reduce the chances they end up in a situation like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carnage4life/status/1532472869334110208\">this</a>, or <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/twitter-rescinds-job-offer-to-new-hire/\">this</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Disclaimer: These questions are direct, but a company that reacts badly to them may not be a good place to work.

In this case, figure out if they will get to a yes. Unless you want to join a sinking ship, of course!</p>\n<p>Early stage founders are (or should be) super-mega-extra-desperately keen to have product-market fit – it's all that really matters. The ones that will succeed are those that are honest about this (or those that have it already) and are prioritizing it. Many will think or say (intentionally or through self-delusion) that they have it when they don't.</p>\n<p>Low user or revenue numbers and vague answers to the example questions above are a sign that it isn't there.
