So I got to thinking ‚Äì what if you want to become awesome, but don‚Äôt want to spend a lot of time basically doing extra work after hours?</p>\n<p>Here are some things me &#x26; people on twitter came up with. Everything in here is stuff I can do during my workday.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dont-learn-programming-languagesframeworks-outside-of-work\">Don‚Äôt learn programming languages/frameworks outside of work<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#dont-learn-programming-languagesframeworks-outside-of-work\"></a></h2>\n<p>... That is interesting and I‚Äôm happy to be doing it. But it is not so fun that I feel like spending a lot of my personal time on it. And I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs necessary, I learn languages by writing them, reading other people‚Äôs code to learn about conventions, and having my code reviewed. I can just do all of those things at work!</p>\n<p>To be clear, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad to learn programming languages outside of work. I just don‚Äôt really do it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"choose-projects-i-think-ill-learn-from\">Choose projects I think I‚Äôll learn from<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#choose-projects-i-think-ill-learn-from\"></a></h2>\n<p>I think it‚Äôs silly when people are like ‚Äúhey, we work with X technologies, you need to have experience with them to work here‚Äù. Right now I spend a lot of time with networking/puppet/kubernetes/docker/AWS and I had never worked with any of those things before this job.</p>\n<h2 id=\"watch-more-senior-people-operate\">Watch more senior people operate<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#watch-more-senior-people-operate\"></a></h2>\n<p>When someone is doing work I really admire, I‚Äôll watch how they do it and then try to emulate them / ask them for advice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"read-every-pull-request\">Read every pull request<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#read-every-pull-request\"></a></h2>\n<p>I don‚Äôt actually read every single pull request on my team. But I <strong>do</strong> find it useful to pick a few areas I want to keep learning about, and keep track over time of the work people are doing in that area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"read-the-source-code\">Read the source code<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#read-the-source-code\"></a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reading source of what I use is a big one for me. Understand what it does internally but mainly why it does it a certain way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is a fantastic tip and super important!! A lot of systems aren‚Äôt really that well documented and you can‚Äôt learn how they work without reading their source code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"follow-up-on-bugs-i-couldnt-figure-out\">Follow up on bugs I couldn‚Äôt figure out<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#follow-up-on-bugs-i-couldnt-figure-out\"></a></h2>\n<h2 id=\"use-your-commute\">Use your commute<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#use-your-commute\"></a></h2>\n<p>I don‚Äôt have a commute but a lot of people mentioned using their commute time to listen to podcasts / read papers / read interesting articles. I think this seems like an awesome way to keep up with things you‚Äôre interested in!</p>\n<h2 id=\"take-the-time-at-work-to-learn\">Take the time at work to learn<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#take-the-time-at-work-to-learn\"></a></h2>\n<p>Someone on Twitter said ‚ÄúI wish I could take 1 hour a day to learn‚Äù.
