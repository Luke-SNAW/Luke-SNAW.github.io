In some ways the front-end web is like a bad manager; the scope keeps growing over time. I don‚Äôt have anything other than anecdotal evidence, but I‚Äôd wager this is a problem that leads to burnout due to context switching among front-end people. Learning new skills is admirable, but the unending list of topics to learn and the vast swings of urgent demands puts you in a state of constant stress and reinvention. ‚ÄúFull-stack‚Äù, <a href=\"https://dev.to/entrptaher/fullstack-developer-is-a-scam-term-3bl2\">as</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/the-full-stack-developer-is-a-myth-4e3fb9c25867\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.andyshora.com/full-stack-developers.html\">have</a> <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/full-stack-developers/\">noted</a> <a href=\"https://www.atlanticbt.com/insights/myth-full-stack-unicorn-developer/\">before</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@alexkatrompas/the-hard-truth-about-the-full-stack-developer-myths-and-lies-945ffadeeb8c\">me</a>, exacerbates this situation.</p>\n<p>Years ago, Chris Coyier summed this struggle up in his post <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/\">The Great Divide</a>. That post was informed by a series we did on ShopTalk called ‚Äú<a href=\"https://shoptalkshow.com/series/how-to-think-like-a-front-end-developer/\">How to think like a Front-End Developer</a>‚Äù. In that series, <a href=\"https://shoptalkshow.com/334/\">Brad Frost</a> divined two sides of the divide as ‚Äúfront of the front‚Äù and ‚Äúback of the front‚Äù and it still resonates with me today. We could probably split the front-end a few ways and still have plenty of jobs to do. Some are proposing bridge roles‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Natalya Shelburne expresses this idea as a bridge role she calls <a href=\"https://shoptalkshow.com/434/\">Design Engineering</a>. This is someone who acts as a bridge between design and engineering. Together with Adekunle Oduye, Kim Williams, and Eddie Lou she wrote the <a href=\"https://www.designbetter.co/design-engineering-handbook/introducing-design-engineering\">Design Engineering Handbook</a> which outlines all the roles and responsibilities of a Design Engineer saying it ‚Äúinvolves setting up individual workflows and organizational structures that facilitate collaboration and communication across the intersection of design and engineering, as well as across product, marketing, and stakeholders.‚Äù If you‚Äôre paying money for good design, this makes sense; protect your investment to make sure the designs get engineered well.</p>\n<p>Alex Sexton proposed a <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/front-end-ops/\">Front-end Ops</a> role as a ‚Äúbridge between an application‚Äôs intent and an application‚Äôs reality‚Äù, managing builds and deployments, performance and error monitoring, and updating dependencies. Even at a modest scale this feels like enough work for a full time job. These are all critical operations that go sideways if not prioritized.</p>\n<p>And there are other bridge roles we haven‚Äôt discovered yet. I personally see the need for new specializations as well. I‚Äôd argue for a ‚ÄúCSS Engineer‚Äù title, someone who knows the ins-and-outs of good CSS architecture that can save your app thousands of lines of code. But that title probably wouldn‚Äôt pay enough, so it‚Äôd need to be more official sounding like ‚ÄúRender Optimization Engineer Level 6‚Äù or something. Now that‚Äôll get the Amazon bucks.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt have answers, only questions as I find myself traversing the spectrum of different jobs a ‚Äúfront-end‚Äù person can do this week. It‚Äôs hard to be an expert at the front-end. And I‚Äôm not sure I like the conclusion of ‚ÄúYou need 12 people just to make a website (or else you get yelled at on Twitter)‚Äù either. That‚Äôs a lot of money, frankly, and would lead to less websites. What‚Äôs one change we could make to eliminate 80% of the work?</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","title":"Luke","desc":"","updated":1761796791487,"created":1644449449778,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"4e745570ca97988a0362cb939b760952","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"life-tips","position":{"start":{"line":41,"column":5,"offset":2603},"end":{"line":41,"column":29,"offset":2627},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"life-tips","anchorHeader":"wodenokoto"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2025","alias":"What I read in 2025","position":{"start":{"line":70,"column":3,"offset":4333},"end":{"line":70,"column":54,"offset":4384},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2025"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2024","alias":"2024","position":{"start":{"line":71,"column":5,"offset":4389},"end":{"line":71,"column":41,"offset":4425},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2024"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2023","alias":"2023","position":{"start":{"line":72,"column":5,"offset":4430},"end":{"line":72,"column":41,"offset":4466},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2023"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-read-in.2022","alias":"2022","position":{"start":{"line":73,"column":5,"offset":4471},"end":{"line":73,"column":41,"offset":4507},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-read-in.2022"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"Iy0MoL0KnL55Br3AfTS2C","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"journal.what-i-struggled-brag-in","position":{"start":{"line":79,"column":3,"offset":4643},"end":{"line":79,"column":39,"offset":4679},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"journal.what-i-struggled-brag-in"}}],"anchors":{"what-i-read-in-past":{"type":"header","text":"What I read in past","value":"what-i-read-in-past","line":74,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["zd4mq442jike0pr0wba1u3m","6hzeqsofq67gdk88flxlkhp","778ijii93yu5uwnrwmn5zi4","g1fngdjl25nes6fs3lip602","ZbdkdApFqLdks4Moq92R9","uoc5hhki3o4py15cesddu8q","9qf7j06jtdkm6rnx9ymvwb0","5zn10cvj7ajy2gh2is5nqmg","4qo9ma0z0yu1czns6pxl7y5","ok0e729ho7o09xetujkxc0m","GR5x8HnNFEN6fU2UBSEIK","yirtnlj8q24yutcf3ss1xqy","eq0wc6t7wl2wv221yb68ro4","7x2fnv4j6gxts08qk0jguny","ettkt3iClONnxpbGwBVLl","7l4knev6v613tbuoskvmbdg","hvh5bud6yp7dc89tuh95tr9","4fvoqrplw0cweo554usbjos","f8qsfql0a9v8thpeo82udfa","1swsbrhqi9jk41v9eodyi5q","SQqYupi6EFddTerBA8RRD","hjNeNc1F2JUh0lTWanH4h","qf0l4wbrc9jgooyzexmbq5v","uur1lkol353z9vfeqb3n5bv","cd9n1czq3ursgkby985wkmm","k1sr43vwnfqztwc0s43pkcf","wfde75rhdvq2yfa2zy2q6rv","rjcmdv60jokmbw6zoq8u2ef","ujapvww8o6v3kpmlhtryq4k","pkwewou9d5e8ystswn1j2b4"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nHi there üëã.
