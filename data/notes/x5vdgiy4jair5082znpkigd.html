<li>Alpine focuses on client-side state and operations, HTMX focuses on interaction with your server.</li>
<li>The core workflow of HTMX is: <em>make a request to the server and swap the response into the page</em>. At first this sounds a lot like every other AJAX workflow, but thereâ€™s a key difference: <strong>the response is returned (and rendered) as HTML.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>htmx is a relatively low level extension to HTML, by design. Unpoly offers a lot more structure, such as layers, which you would need to implement on your own or using another library (e.g. tailwinds or bootstrap) if you are using htmx.</li>
<li>This is reflected in their overall sizes: 11k for htmx, 41k for unpoly.</li>
<li>I don't view either as better in general: they are two different approaches to building hypermedia-oriented applications, one more structured and one less. Which one is better for your particular application depends on your own engineering needs and tastes.</li>
