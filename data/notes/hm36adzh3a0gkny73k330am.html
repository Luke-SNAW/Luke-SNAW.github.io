<p>The reason why this happens is an intentional feature of the React.StrictMode. It<strong> only happens in development mode</strong> and should help to find accidental side effects in the render phase.</p>

<p>The main reason is <code>React.StrictMode</code> which was introduced in version 16.3.0. Back then it only could be used for class components. With the release of 16.8.0 it is also applied for hooks.</p>

<p>React will soon provide a new <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html"><strong>Concurrent Mode</strong></a> which will break render work into multiple parts. Pausing and resuming the work between this parts should avoid the blocking of the browsers main thread.</p>
