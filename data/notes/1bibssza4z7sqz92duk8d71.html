<ul>
<li>Startups can beat incumbents by doing things the incumbent cannot or will not do, such as taking on higher risk, targeting smaller niches, and leveraging new technologies.</li>
<li>Incumbents struggle with scale - the more customers they have, the harder it is to innovate and make changes to their products and services. This gives startups an advantage.</li>
<li>Startups can often ignore regulations and laws that incumbents must follow, allowing them to move faster and take more risks.</li>
<li>Incumbents require a high return on investment to justify new initiatives, whereas startups can target smaller opportunities that may not meet the incumbent's materiality thresholds.</li>
<li>Startups can leverage new technologies that incumbents are hesitant to adopt due to the risks and challenges of integrating them at scale.</li>
<li>Startups can provide better, more personalized customer support than large incumbents, fostering loyalty and advocacy.</li>
<li>Startups can focus on specific customer segments and needs that incumbents overlook or cannot efficiently serve.</li>
<li>Incumbents are constrained by their existing business models and assets, making it difficult for them to compete with lean, agile startups.</li>
<li>Startups should target non-zero-sum marketing channels that incumbents cannot easily dominate, rather than competing head-to-head.</li>
<li>Startups can be "worse but unique" - providing a more limited but differentiated product at a lower cost compared to the incumbent's comprehensive offering.</li>
