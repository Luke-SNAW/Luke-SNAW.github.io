<h2 id="why-should-we-document-software-architecture">Why should we document software architecture?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-should-we-document-software-architecture"></a></h2>
<p>An often expressed opinion about software architecture documentation in "agile" teams is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The code documents the system. We don't need any further documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this statement is only half the truth. There are several questions that remain unanswered in the code.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the goals of the system?</li>
<li>What are the non-functional requirements?</li>
<li>What are the architectural decisions and their arguments?</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>As <a href="https://simonbrown.je/">Simon Brown</a> has correctly pointed out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The code doesn't tell the whole story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long story short: You should document the software architecture of your system. Take a look at the <strong>goals</strong> you should fulfil with your documentation, and you'll understand <strong>why</strong>.</p>
<p>Blog Post: Technical debt due to lack of documentation</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.workingsoftware.dev/technical-debt-scenario-5-the-code-documents-the-system/">Technical Debt Scenario #5: The code documents the system.</a> - Unfortunately, several long-time developers have left the product team. In addition, there is virtually no technical documentation for the system. Even the architectural decisions are no longer traceable. What would you do to eliminate this kind of technical debt?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="goals-of-software-architecture-documentation">Goals of software architecture documentation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#goals-of-software-architecture-documentation"></a></h3>
<p>There are three goals that your software architecture documentation should fulfil.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Software architecture documentation creates a common understanding</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Software architecture documentation should at least support the development team, for example, when a new team member starts.</p>
<p>Let's take the onboarding example, a new team member has a lot of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where can I find an overview of the system's building blocks?</li>
<li>Why are you using <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> and not <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>? Why are you using <a href="https://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> and not <a href="https://www.jooq.org/">jOOQ</a>?</li>
<li>Where and how is the system deployed?</li>
<li>Are there any conventions I need to be aware of?</li>
</ul>
<p>This brings us to the first goal of software architecture documentation:</p>
<p><strong>Software architecture documentation creates a common understanding of the solution behind the system for various stakeholders</strong></p>
<p>There are usually many different stakeholders interested in different aspects of our system: Software Architects, Software Engineers, Ops, Support, Testing, POs, Project Managers, SMEs, Business Sponsors and so on.</p>
<p>You can create different views of your system's architecture by developing a common understanding of your system's software architecture.</p>
<p>With this understanding, the various stakeholders can evaluate the underlying software architecture from their perspective.</p>
<p>In this way, we can concretize the goal described above with the evaluation part:</p>
<p><strong>The documentation makes it possible to evaluate the software architecture from the perspective of the various stakeholders</strong></p>
<p>Software architecture documentation allows your stakeholders to judge whether the system is achieving the goal, since they often can't dive into the code.</p>
<p>With good architecture documentation, they can answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the chosen architecture fit the solution?</li>
<li>Is the architecture appropriate?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, architectural documentation often prevents other goals, constraints, and non-functional requirements from creeping in.</p>
<p>Let me give a practical example here.</p>
<p>I've often heard from various stakeholders: "<em>The system must be fast</em>."</p>
<p>But what does that mean?</p>
<p>As a software architect, you have to turn these expectations into concrete quality goals, i.e., non-functional requirements with supporting quality scenarios. You record these quality goals in the architecture documentation, which in turn helps your team to implement the solution with the agreed non-functional requirements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software architecture documentation supports architectural work</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Software architecture documentation supports team work</strong></p>
<p>Software architecture is a team effort, so it's most important that the software architecture documentation supports your team effort.</p>
<p>See also this article about the role of the software architect</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.workingsoftware.dev/do-we-need-a-software-architect-in-our-agile-team/">Do we need a software architect in our agile team?</a> - This question often comes up in agile teams. In this blog post, we look for the answer to this question in the context of the various agile and organisational frameworks like Scrum, LeSS, SAFe, Disciplined Agile and draw a conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a team member, it's important to actively know (and pass on to new team members) the goals, constraints, and non-functional requirements within the team. This information is often very important in team architecture workshops.</p>
<p>It's important to make understandable and comprehensible architecture decisions. Nothing is more annoying than not knowing why you decided the way you did.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software architecture documentation guides the development team in implementing new product features</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Documenting software architecture helps the entire development team implement the solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>What <em>constraints</em> do I need to consider?</li>
<li>Which <em>non-functional</em> requirements do I need to test?</li>
<li>Which <em>overarching</em> concepts do I need to follow?</li>
<li>Are there architectural decisions I need to consider when implementing a particular feature?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Software architecture documentation supports the communication with external stakeholders</strong></p>
<p>A large part of software architecture work is communication. In particular, communication with stakeholders is key to effective and focused discussion outcomes.</p>
<p>Good software architecture documentation supports communication with external stakeholders. It contains different and stakeholder-appropriate views of the software architecture.</p>

<p>❌ <strong>Upfront document everything</strong></p>
<p>Don't document everything in advance. Think of the arc42 template as a cabinet for documentation. You put something on a shelf as you work on it. This is how software architecture documentation emerges, evolves, and stays<br>
current.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Don't includes Tutorials or Q&#x26;A sections</strong></p>
<p>The most important thing in arc42 is the structure. The structure doesn’t<br>
provide a space for guides or Q&#x26;A sections.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Don't put any specific things like customer names or similar</strong></p>
<p>Don't write customer-specific things in the software architecture documentation, unless your building blocks are structured in a customer-oriented way.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://c4model.com/">C4 model</a> is a good approach to obtain a common set of abstractions. It's an abstraction-first approach and is notation independent.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://c4model.com/">C4 model</a> looks at the static structures of a <strong>software system</strong> in terms of <strong>containers</strong>, <strong>components</strong> and <strong>code</strong>. And <strong>people</strong> use the software systems we build.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.workingsoftware.dev/content/images/2022/12/image-60.png"></p>
<p>Abstractions of the C4 Model (<a href="https://c4model.com/">Source</a>)</p>
<p><strong>What is a software system in C4?</strong><br>
A software system is the highest level of abstraction and describes<br>
something that adds value to its users, whether they are human<br>
or not.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Container in C4?</strong><br>
A container (not Docker!) is a separately deployable / executable thing.</p>
<p><strong>What is Component in C4?</strong><br>
A component is a grouping of related functionality encapsulated<br>
behind a well-defined interface. If you're using a language like Java or C#, the easiest way to think of a component is that it's a collection of implementation classes behind an interface.</p>

<p>With these abstractions, we can create a <a href="https://c4model.com/">context view (Level 1)</a>, <a href="https://c4model.com/#ContainerDiagram">a container view (Level 2)</a>, <a href="https://c4model.com/#ComponentDiagram">a component view (Level 3)</a> and <a href="https://c4model.com/#CodeDiagram">a code view (Level 4)</a>.</p>

<p>The four levels of the C4 Model. Each level has a different target audience (<a href="https://c4model.com/">Source</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Level 1: System Context Diagram</strong></p>

<p><strong>Level 2: Container Diagram</strong></p>
<p>If we zoom into the system (the internet banking system in the figure above), we get the container view of this system.</p>
<p>Each of these containers is separately deployable.</p>

<p>A container diagram (<a href="https://c4model.com/">Source</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Level 3: Component Diagram</strong></p>
<p>If we want to take a look inside a specific container, like the API application, we get the component view of that container.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.workingsoftware.dev/content/images/2022/12/image-58.png"></p>
<p>A component diagram (<a href="https://c4model.com/">Source</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Level 4: Code</strong></p>
<p>If we go deep into a particular component, we arrive at a "code" view.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.workingsoftware.dev/content/images/2022/12/image-59.png"></p>
<p>Level 4: Code Diagram (<a href="https://c4model.com/">Source</a>)</p>
<p>This can be a class diagram. But you can often generate this kind of view by an idea, if necessary.</p>

<p>As with any software, there are requirements for technical documentation. Gernot Starke has excellently documented these requirements in the following blog post:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/articles/2022/01/principles-of-technical-documentation/">Principles of technical documentation</a> - This article collects fundamental requirements for technicaldocumentation, especially software architecture documentation, togetherwith ideas how to <em>satisfy</em> those.</p>
<p>A summary of the documentation requirements can be seen in the following figure from the blog post above:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.workingsoftware.dev/content/images/2022/12/image-61.png"></p>
<p>All documentation requirements (<a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/articles/2022/01/principles-of-technical-documentation/">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Meeting some of these requirements (e.g., <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/articles/2022/01/principles-of-technical-documentation/#sect-maintainable">req-7</a>, <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/articles/2022/01/principles-of-technical-documentation/#sect-version-controlled">req-9</a>, <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/articles/2022/01/principles-of-technical-documentation/#sect-tools">req-10</a>, and <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/articles/2022/01/principles-of-technical-documentation/#sect-continuously">req-11</a>) leads to the conclusion that we should treat the document as code "Documentation as Code" or "Docs-as-Code".</p>
<h3 id="what-is-documentation-as-code-">What is "Documentation as Code" ?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#what-is-documentation-as-code-"></a></h3>
<p>"Documentation as Code" means that your documentation process benefits from the same practices you use to develop successful software.</p>
<p>Some of these practices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storing content in a version control system</li>
<li>Separation of content, configuration, and presentation</li>
<li>Use of automation for compilation, validation, verification and publishing (CI/CD)</li>
<li>Reuse shared materials (DRY)</li>
<li>...and use your IDE to write content ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>With this technique we get some value out-of-the-box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structuring of the whole document into subdocuments</li>
<li>Restructuring of the documentation according to specific stakeholder</li>
<li>Reference images, not embedding</li>
<li>Simple versioning "handle documentation as code”</li>
<li>Format of the documentation content like source code</li>
<li>Documentation Reviews, pull requests, versioning through Git tooling</li>
<li>Conversion to various presentation formats like HTML5, PDF, DocBook, Confluence, ...</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.workingsoftware.dev/content/images/2022/12/image-62.png"></p>
<p>Treat documentation like code in a common development workflow</p>
<h3 id="are-there-any-recommended-tools-for-documentation-as-code">Are there any recommended tools for Documentation as Code?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#are-there-any-recommended-tools-for-documentation-as-code"></a></h3>
<p>In Documentation as Code we can distinguish the following process steps: <strong><em>Authoring</em></strong> (write, validate and preview the documentation content), <em><strong>Converting</strong></em> (documents to the pulication formats like HTML, DocBook, PDF, etc.), and <strong><em>Publishing</em></strong> (Build and deploy documentation artefacts). For each of these steps there are some tools that I can recommend to fulfil the process step.</p>
<p><strong><em>Authoring</em>: <a href="https://asciidoc.org/"><em>AsciiDoc</em></a></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://asciidoc.org/">AsciiDoc</a> is a plain text markup language for writing technical content. Use the <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">AsciiDoc</a> format to write your content.</p>
<p><em><strong>Convert: <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a></strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a> is a fast processor for parsing AsciiDoc® into a document model and converting it to output formats such as HTML 5, DocBook 5, manual pages, PDF, EPUB 3, and other formats.</p>
<p><strong><em>Publish:</em></strong> <em>Maven, Gradle, <a href="http://doctoolchain.org/">docToolChain</a></em></p>
<p><a href="http://doctoolchain.org/">docToolchain</a> is a collection of scripts that makes it easy to create and maintain powerful technical documentation. Built on best-of-breed open source technologies, we deliver the best docs toolchain so you don’t have to.</p>
<p>Available tasks of the docToolchain (<a href="http://doctoolchain.org/docToolchain/v2.0.x/015_tasks/03_tasks.html">Source</a>)</p>
<h3 id="and-whats-about-diagrams">And what's about diagrams?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#and-whats-about-diagrams"></a></h3>
<p>Like documentation, you can treat diagrams like code.</p>
<p><strong>Diagrams as Code 1.0</strong></p>
<p>A classical approach to describe diagrams in text can be done with <a href="https://plantuml.com/de/">PlantUML</a>, <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/#/">Mermaid</a> or <a href="https://graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a>.</p>
<p>Describe a diagram with text in PlantUML</p>
<p>These diagrams can be embedded directly into AsciiDoc content and converted with AsciiDoctor.</p>
<pre><code>[plantuml, target=diagram-classes, format=png]
....
class BlockProcessor
class DiagramBlock
class DitaaBlock
class PlantUmlBlock

BlockProcessor &#x3C;|-- DiagramBlock
DiagramBlock &#x3C;|-- DitaaBlock
DiagramBlock &#x3C;|-- PlantUmlBlock
....
</code></pre>
<p>PlantUML Code in AsciiDoc embedded</p>
<p>Now let's combine diagrams as code and the C4 model. This brings us to Diagrams as Code 2.0.</p>
<p><strong>Diagrams as Code 2.0</strong></p>
<p>What if we could describe our C4 model in text form and generate the C4 diagrams directly?<br>
This is where <a href="https://structurizr.com/">Structurizr</a> comes in. It brings diagrams as code into a new dimension - Diagrams as Code 2.0.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://structurizr.com/dsl">Structurizr DSL</a> we can describe the Software with the C4 abstractions.</p>
<p>Structurizr DSL Example (<a href="https://structurizr.com/dsl?example=big-bank-plc">Source</a>)</p>
<p>After describing the C4 model of our software system, we can create all defined views directly (with different representations).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.workingsoftware.dev/content/images/2022/12/image-70.png"></p>
<p>Awesome, isn't it?</p>
<p>By the way: Simon Browns gave a great talk about diagrams as code 2.0 with <a href="https://structurizr.com/dsl">Structurizr</a>.</p>
<h3 id="combine-everything-together">Combine everything together<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#combine-everything-together"></a></h3>
<p>Now you have the whole toolbox for software architecture documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structure it with <a href="https://arc42.org/">arc42</a></li>
<li>Describe and visualize it with the <a href="https://c4model.com/">C4 model</a></li>
