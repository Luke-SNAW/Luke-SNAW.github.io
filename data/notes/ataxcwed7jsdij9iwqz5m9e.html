<ul>
<li>AI summarization tools, while beneficial, should not be solely relied upon by researchers who need to apply critical thinking and subjective understanding.</li>
<li>The author developed a method called Bilingual Shadow Reasoning to demonstrate how AI model outputs, particularly in multilingual summarization, can be subtly steered by customized policies (system prompts), potentially bypassing safety guardrails.</li>
<li>Customized policies can align LLM outputs with specific political or cultural framings, as shown in an example where Farsi-language policies mirrored the Iranian government's framing of human rights to conceal violations.</li>

<ul>
<li>The sky appears blue because blue photons from sunlight are scattered more by Earth's atmosphere than other colors, dispersing them throughout the sky.</li>
<li>The preferential scattering of blue light is due to the resonant frequencies of nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere, which are closer to the frequency of blue light.</li>
<li>Violet light scatters even more than blue light, but the sky appears blue rather than violet because human eyes are less sensitive to violet light.</li>
<li>Sunsets appear red because the sunlight travels through more atmosphere, scattering away most of the blue and green light, leaving primarily red light to reach our eyes.</li>

<li>Nonviolent protests are twice as likely to succeed as armed conflicts.</li>
<li>Civil resistance involving a threshold of 3.5% of the population actively participating has never failed to bring about change.</li>
<li>Erica Chenoweth's research analyzed hundreds of campaigns over the last century to compare the success rates of nonviolent versus violent protests.
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Chenoweth has backed off her previous conclusions in recent years, observing that nonviolent protest strategies have dramatically declined in effectiveness as governments have adjusted their tactics of repression and messaging.

<li>This sounds exactly like what Google used to say about search results. Just a few ads, clearly separated from organic results, never detracting from the core mission of providing the most effective access to all the world’s information. (And certainly not driven by a secret profile of you based on pervasive surveillance of your internet activity.) - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46650756">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46650756</a></li>
<li>People are reacting negatively to the ads, but there's a bigger point. This is bearish as heck for AGI. If OpenAI were recursively improving their general-computer-using agent, who was going to be superhuman at every job, they wouldn't need to be messing around with things like this. - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46653567">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46653567</a></li>
