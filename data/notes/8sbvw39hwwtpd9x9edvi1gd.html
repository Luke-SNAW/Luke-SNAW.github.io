<p>A smart accountant once told me that the answer to "How much money did you make?" is always, "Who wants to know?" If it's an investor, the answer is "A lot." If it's a customer, the answer is "A little." If it's the IRS, the answer is "None."
Same thing here. The answer to "Who is a superstar developer?" is always, "Who wants to know?"</p>
<p>To a project manager, the programmer who hits every deadline (regardless of quality) is a superstar.</p>
<p>To a customer, the programmer who solves their problem quickest is a superstar.</p>
<p>To a business owner, the programmer who makes them the most money is a superstar.</p>
<p>To a PHB, the programmer who makes them look the best is the superstar.</p>
<p>To a journalist, the programmer who tells the best stories is the superstar.</p>
<p>To a junior programmer, the best mentor is the superstar.</p>
<p>To another programmer, the programmer they are most likely to want to go into battle with is the superstar.</p>
