<li>Kalman filters combine multiple noisy measurements to produce a more accurate estimate.</li>
<li>They are useful because real-life measurements are often imperfect and unreliable due to factors like sensor noise and malfunction.</li>
<li>An example is estimating the location of a ship using both its velocity and GPS sensor measurements. Both are imperfect so a Kalman filter can combine them.</li>
<li>The Kalman filter takes a weighted average of the measurements, with more weight given to the more reliable source based on its variance.</li>
<li>The code simulates 1000 passengers on a ship estimating its location using noisy velocity and sensor measurements.</li>
<li>The Kalman filter calculates the variance of the measurements to determine the trustworthiness of each source.</li>
<li>It then takes a weighted average based on the trust values to produce a combined position estimate.</li>
<li>The results show the combined estimate is better than either measurement alone, especially when one source has a glitch.</li>
<li>The Kalman filter automatically adjusts for variations and provides a reasonably reliable estimate.</li>
