<p>While many people think only about the code when they create a PR, context is essential for understanding and reviewing that PR.</p>
<p>Reviewers must know what the fundamental problem is before they can understand if it’s been resolved. Don’t force a reviewer to read through 600 lines of code. Instead, provide a descriptive PR title and high-level summary at the top of the PR.</p>
<p>This is why it's good practice to create and enforce the use of PR templates, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem</li>
<li>Solution</li>
<li>Impact</li>
<li>Testing plan</li>
</ul>

<p>Why does direct communication help?</p>
<ul>
<li>Feedback will be faster.</li>
<li>Verbal communication leads to fewer misunderstandings.</li>
<li>10 minutes of verbal communication is a much more thorough review than a few back and forth GitHub comments.</li>
<li>Direct conversation prevents constant context switching between other work and checking the PR comment section.</li>

<p>Sometimes we want our code merged in quickly, so we seek an approval instead of a proper review and dialogue. However, shallow reviews defeat the purpose of code review.</p>
<p>One step that can help open up a dialogue is to request more reviewers.</p>
<p>Why does requesting more reviewers help?</p>
<ul>
<li>It adds more perspectives. If only one approval is required, and only one review requested, other teammates will never get a chance to disagree.</li>
<li>People are available at different times. Requesting more reviewers increases the likelihood that eyes get on the PR sooner.</li>
<li>If there’s a more general coding style/design disagreement in the PR, others have a chance to weigh in or at least become aware of it.</li>
<li>Standups are by nature more status updates than working in the weeds. When someone is requested on a PR, they can read exactly what a teammate is working on and can reference that code if they encounter a similar issue.</li>
</ul>
