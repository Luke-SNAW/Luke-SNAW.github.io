## Programming Language

### Static typing helps, but only a little.

A [statically-typed](https://buildtogether.tech/glossary/#static_typing) language like Java requires programmers to specify the data type of each variable; a [dynamically-typed](https://buildtogether.tech/glossary/#dynamic_typing) one like Python doesn't require them, though you can add them if you want, while TypeScript adds types as a layer on top of JavaScript. \[[Endrikat2014](https://buildtogether.tech/bibliography/#Endrikat2014)\] found that declaring types does add complexity to programs, but it pays off fairly quickly by acting as documentation and by making [auto-completion](https://buildtogether.tech/glossary/#auto_completion) more accurate.
