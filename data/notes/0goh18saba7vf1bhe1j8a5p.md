I ask these indirectly.

"What types of people tend to succeed and do well with your team? What types of people tend to struggle in your team?"
(Am I going to be a culture and work/life balance fit?)

"What are your main objectives in the next 6 to 12 months? What's your plan to meet those objectives?"
(Do these guys have their act together and an actual plan? Is the work going to be interesting?)

"How do you see the candidate in this role contributing to that objective?"
(Are their expectations for this role realistic? Do I fit those expectations? Do I want to be on that ride?)

"Tell me about how the team collaborates and coordinates work"
(Am I going to be stuck in 1 hour all-hands daily "stand-ups" every day?)
