<p>There is so much to go around. The world is abundant and not zero-sum. I intentionally let people take advantage of me because I know I’ll recover whatever I need in another way.
A useful habit is to practice random acts of kindness daily, whenever convenient.</p>

<ul>
<li>Before giving feedback, assess your own role in the situation and consider if the issue is worth addressing.</li>
<li>Use the "even more" technique to frame feedback positively, suggesting enhancements rather than criticizing past actions.</li>
<li>Share personal experiences instead of directly telling the leader what to do to reduce defensiveness.</li>
<li>Employ diplomatic language that invites collaboration, such as "What are your thoughts on..." or "Perhaps we could..."</li>
<li>Offer concrete examples and data to support your feedback, making it more persuasive and actionable.</li>
<li>Position your feedback to focus on future improvements rather than past mistakes to prevent a defensive reaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No one likes meetings. They’re sending their AI note takers instead.

<li>Debating with a skilled opponent can be challenging, as they can control the conversation's framing, leading to a loss of momentum and confidence.</li>
<li>Framing a conversation in your terms is a powerful debating strategy.</li>
<li>This framing allows inevitabilists to dismiss opposing views and engage only with those who accept their premise.</li>

<p>I've been in therapy for over a year and one of the most valuable things I've learned as a fellow "problem solver" is to run through the "three H's" when something comes up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you want to be Helped?</li>
<li>Do you want to be Heard?</li>
<li>Do you want to be Hugged?</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm still trying to get in the habit of using this approach more often with my partner, and as I do, it has noticeably improved our relationship. It turns out most of the time, she just wants to be hugged. - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46695055">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46695055</a></p>

<p>It doesn't matter what your title is, how much expert education, training, or experience you have, or even what hard lessons that you have learned: you are not an "expert" in an area unless you are invited in as an "expert". Put another way, unsolicited advice is unwelcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smart people want to solve their own problems. Don't offer solutions. No one will feel empowered or much of a sense of accomplishment implementing your solution. Instead tell them the challenges that they will face for various options and let them draw their own conclusions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your spouse just wants to vent, UNLESS they say "fix it" in which case they want you to fix it, where "fix" means "make it act like I want it to". Your spouse does not want to know how it works so that they can fix it themselves next time, and their mental model is wrong and they don't care to correct it. Just listen, figure out what they want and do it yourself, and do it again next time even though it interrupted you and they could have fixed it themself.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kant revolutionized Western philosophy by destroying the idea of absolute common sense and arguing that the focus should be on analyzing the subject (perspective of the observer) rather than the object.</li>
<li>We each view the world through our own unique perspective based on our experiences and biases. There are no universal truths or correct answers.</li>
<li>Interpersonal relationships are often based on superficial advice that doesn't lead to real understanding or communication between individuals.</li>
<li>Wittgenstein argued that all communication and interaction is based on "language games" that involve specific contexts, emotions, and meanings beyond just words.</li>
<li>To have genuine understanding, we must try to grasp the intentions and perspectives of others rather than make assumptions.</li>
<li>Some people use justifications like "the world made me this way" to avoid responsibility, but <strong>we should seek to understand their perspective without condoning harmful actions</strong>.</li>
<li>Developing empathy, self-awareness of biases, and listening skills can help improve interpersonal relationships and resolve conflicts.</li>
<li>Individuals who think outside rigid frameworks have changed society by pursuing their own visions.</li>
<li>Art like Picasso's paintings show there are no fixed or single correct ways of viewing something.</li>
<li>Communication is a <strong>skill that requires practice understanding others' emotions and intentions through "language games"</strong>.</li>
