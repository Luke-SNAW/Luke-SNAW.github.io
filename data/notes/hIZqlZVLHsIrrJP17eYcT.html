<p>Google Tag Manager is a TMS (Tag Management System): it allows marketing teams to add trackers to a website or application, without having to go through developers. Via a web interface, these teams can decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracers to be triggered (analytics, A / B testing, attribution, etc.).</li>
<li>Trigger conditions (categories of pages, user characteristics, etc.).</li>
<li>Data to be transmitted to these third-party tools (user characteristics, navigation data, variables present on the page, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Tag Manager is present on 31.9% of the top 10 million Alexa websites, according to W3Techs, but above all Google Tag Manager has a 99.4% market share on TMS (!)</p>
