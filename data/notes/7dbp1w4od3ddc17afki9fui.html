<ol>
<li>Regarding the advice to star the repos before leaving, does this mean that only commits post-starring will remain? Or is starring once sufficient to retain all past commits?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ans - all commits will remain, so star the repositories as soon as you can just in case.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What if commits were made using a company email?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ans - Unverify your company email address by deleting it in your Email settings. You can then re-add it without verifying to keep any associated commits linked to your account.
