<p>Reflecting on my year-end downtime, I thought about the impact of molding my everyday work routine around my to-do lists. As a child, I was taught to finish up my chores and homework first and have fun later. This is how I planned my days too. Work, chores, and errands had to be completed first, and fun was mostly short and accidental or, if I postponed it long enough, a late-night binge on cat reels. In recent years, I realized that my novelty-motivated brain craves short and long breaks, and when it doesn’t get its little crumbs of joy it burns out. This prompted a quest for more joy in my everyday life and a radical idea of maybe generously sprinkling my to-do lists with things that I enjoy.</p>
<p>A few months ago after watching Jessica McCabe's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6WCkTwW6xg">How to Give Your Brain the Stimulation It Needs</a>," I learned about crafting a personalized "dopamine menu" – a curated list of fulfilling activities categorized as starters, main courses, sides, desserts, and specials. Here’s what it means.</p>
<p><strong>Starters or appetizers:</strong> These are quick, light activities designed to ease creativity or transition from a period of low energy to a more productive state. They're like the warm-up exercises before diving into deeper creative work. These activities are meant to be engaging but not overly absorbing, perfect for taking breaks or getting mentally prepared for more challenging tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Main courses:</strong> Think of these as substantial and fulfilling activities that form the core of your creative experience. These are the tasks or projects that bring you genuine joy and fulfillment, requiring more time and investment. They're the backbone of your artistic journey, be it long-term projects, experiments, or explorations that truly "fill your cup" creatively.</p>
<p><strong>Sides:</strong> These are the supplementary elements that enhance your creative experience, much like side dishes complement a main course. They're meant to add flavor and enjoyment to your creative process, making it more pleasant or efficient. Sides could be ambient music, podcasts, or small rituals that elevate your workspace or mindset.</p>
<p><strong>Desserts:</strong> These are the indulgent but mindful activities that are enjoyable in moderation. While they might not contribute directly to your primary creative goals, they still can provide inspiration or relaxation. However, excessive time spent here might leave you feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p><strong>Specials:</strong> Consider these as occasional or planned experiences. They're not part of your routine but are significant in bringing joy, inspiration, or growth. These activities might include attending workshops, investing in expensive art materials, or indulging in unique experiences that deeply inspire or fuel your creativity.</p>
<p>If you've noticed my “Things That Bring Me Joy” lists in newsletters, you'll see a theme. Channeling this, I created my joy cheat sheet. After a few weeks of using it, I realized it could also be tailored to artists facing art block or seeking motivation on dull winter days.</p>
<p>Here are some of the activities I came up with. Of course, your dopamine menu can include anything that brings a smile to your face or helps you relax or feel more energized.</p>
