<li>
<p>Object-oriented programming is not inherently bad, but the pervasive use of classes as the primary unit of abstraction leads to problems. Not all code needs to be organized into classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encapsulating all code and data into rigid classes results in abstractions that do not fit problems well and introduce unnecessary complexity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared state and implicit coupling between objects caused by shared mutable objects undermine encapsulation and make code difficult to understand and maintain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java popularized OOP but did not prove it is the best paradigm. Its success was also due to addressing other issues at the time rather than benefits of OOP itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code with many small, fractured units like tiny classes and methods scattered across files is difficult to comprehend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedural programming that minimizes shared state through parameterization is a viable alternative to favor in many cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pure functions are the ideal unit of code as they are fully self-contained. Code should opportunistically embrace purity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Longer methods with descriptive comments can be easier to understand than decomposing logic into many smaller units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data types can help logically organize global state without requiring rigid classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Language features like inline blocks that encapsulate code without extracting it could help address issues while keeping code linear.</p>
</li>
