<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-ai-is-an-ideology-not-a-technology/">AI is an Ideology, Not a Technology</a> argues that artificial intelligence is better understood as an ideology rather than just a technology. It promotes a view of autonomous machine intelligence that could replace humans, but this is a mirage since AI relies heavily on human data and contributions. An alternative view is to focus on how people are central to developing AI systems through providing examples, problem-solving and understanding the technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.votito.com/methods/togs-paradox/">Tog's paradox</a> (also known as The Complexity Paradox or Tog’s Complexity Paradox) is an observation that products aiming to simplify a task for users tend to inspire new, more complex tasks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Travel became simpler → more vacations now involve flying a plane and thus obtaining tickets online and thus comparison-shopping, aggregating reviews of faraway places, etc → omg, vacation travel is complex again. It just allows to fulfill more of a dream. — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41914693">nine_k</a></p>
<p>Tog's paradox is the main reason why I suspect that generative AI will never destroy art, it will enhance it. It allows you to create artworks within minutes that until recently required hours to create and years to master. This will cause new art to emerge that pushes these new tools to the limit, again with years of study and mastery, and they will look like nothing we've been able to produce so far. — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41914285">posix86</a></p>

<p>This has been my complaint about AI from the beginning, and it hasn't gotten better. In the time spend I figuring out how to explain to the AI what I need it to do, I can just sit down and figure it out. AI, for me, has never been a useful assistant for writing code.
Where AI has really improved my productivity is in acting like a colleague I can talk to. "I'm going to start working on X: how would you approach it? what should I know that isn't obvious from the beginning?" or "I am thinking about using Y approach for X problem but I don't see a lot of literature about it. Is there a reason it's not more common?".</p>
<p>These "chats" only take 10-30 minutes and have already led me to learn a bunch of new things, and helps keep me moving on projects where in the past I'd have spent 2-3x as long working through ideas, searching for literature, and figuring things out.</p>

하지만, 실제 프로젝트에 사용된 프롬프트들은 AI 코딩에 가장 잘 먹히는 방식과 일치함

(2) 반복적이거나 지루한 일 처리 - 코드 주석, 설정 파일 작성 등은 내가 할 수도 있지만 속도를 늦추는 일들을 무난하게 처리함
(3) 검색 - (1)번처럼 실제로 내가 원하는 게 뭔지 AI가 파악해 필터링이나 추천 등을 맡김

단, 생성된 코드 중 쉽게 검증되지 않는 부분을 충분히 검토해야 한다는 ‘덫’이 있음
고도 표현력을 가진 언어 덕분에 사전 플랜 없는 사람들이 난장판 코드베이스를 양산하기도 했던 것처럼, AI 도구로도 이런 일이 반복될 항목
하지만 내가 진짜 시간 절약하는 부분은, 완전히 새 코드를 짜는 것보다 옛 코드와 신 코드를 통합하거나 개선할 때임
디버깅에서 큰 도약이 일어남
예전처럼 print만 찍지 않고, 코드를 복사해 붙여넣기만 해도 “출력이 이렇지 않고 저렇다는 데 왜 그렇냐?”고 AI에게 물어 빠르게 원인과 대안을 얻을 수 있음
특히 SQL, IaC, 빌드 스크립트 등 디버거 붙이기 어려운 작업에서 이런 방식이 엄청나게 큰 장점임</p>
