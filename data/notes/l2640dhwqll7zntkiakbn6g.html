<p>How do we get more work done? It is a question that every manager and every passionate worker faces. Yet, for the most part, teams operate on gut instinct and habit. The results are less than optimal. [<a href="http://www.lostgarden.com/2008/09/rules-of-productivity-presentation.html">source</a>]</p>
<h2 id="what-is-productivity">What is productivity?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#what-is-productivity"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>+ Work accomplished</li>
<li>- Work required to fix defects</li>
<li>- Work required to fix bad design decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>Productivity can be <strong><em>negative</em></strong> when there is more harm than good.</p>

<h2 id="experiment-1-overtime">Experiment 1: Overtime<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#experiment-1-overtime"></a></h2>
<p>Working more than  40 hours a week leads to decreased productivity.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#x3C; 40 hours/week – working not “enough”.</li>
<li>> 60 hours/week – small productivity boost.</li>
</ul>
<p>The boost only lasts for 3 to 4 weeks and then turns <em><strong>negative</strong></em>. Though can be used for a short-time productivity increase.</p>
<p>So, work 40 hours a week with time for rest and family. Never work 2 months of 60 hrs/week. Overall productivity will be lower, despite the initial boost.</p>
<h2 id="experiment-2-work-harder-in-bursts">Experiment 2: Work harder in bursts.<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#experiment-2-work-harder-in-bursts"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Take advantage of the burst during overtime.</li>
<li>Crunch for a week and work only 40 hrs on another week.</li>
<li>Any more efficient work patterns?</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything over 40 hrs/week results in a recovery period, no matter how you split it up. 40 hrs/week can be 10 hrs/day for 4 days and one day off. This pattern of work can increase productivity by 10-70%.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/management/rules-of-productivity__crunch.webp"></p>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raise productivity immediately with short spurts &#x3C; 3 weeks.</li>
<li>Overtime temporarily to meet deadlines.</li>
<li>Plan for the reduction in productivity immediately afterwards.</li>
<li>Consider 4-day work week as a flexitime option.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Creativity and problem solving decreases faster with fatigue than manual labour.</li>
<li>Grinding  out problems by working longer  on average result in inferior solutions.</li>
<li>Lack of sleep is particularly damaging.</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overtime kills creativity.</li>
<li>If you are stuck on a problem, go home or take a break.</li>
<li>Get 8 hrs of sleep to improve your problem solving abilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="experiment-4-teams-on-overtime-feel-like-they-are-doing-more-but-actually-accomplish-less">Experiment 4: Teams on overtime feel like they are doing more, but actually accomplish less.<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#experiment-4-teams-on-overtime-feel-like-they-are-doing-more-but-actually-accomplish-less"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Team with overtime feels like they are doing much more than the team without overtime.</li>
<li>Team without overtime produces the better product and accomplishes more.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/images/management/rules-of-productivity__perveived.webp"></p>
<p>Humans ignore the systematic costs and physiological biases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failure to measure (cost of defects, bad design decisions, missed opportunities).</li>
<li>Linear extrapolation (initial productivity boost is seen as same in the future).</li>
<li>Habit (a bad one!).</li>
<li>Self reported excellence (behaviour rewarded independent of the results).</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>The feeling of increased long-term productivity is FALSE.</li>
<li>Use customer metrics to determine the productivity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="experiment-5-productivity-is-maximised-in-small-teams-of-4-8-people">Experiment 5: Productivity is maximised in small teams of 4-8 people.<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#experiment-5-productivity-is-maximised-in-small-teams-of-4-8-people"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Productivity of a small group is 30-50% higher than groups over 10 people.</li>
<li>Too high cost of communication for groups with > 10 people.</li>
<li>Smaller teams don’t have enough breadth to solve a wide array of problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split your teams into cross-functional teams.</li>
<li>Link small teams using '”scrum-of-scrums”.</li>
<li>Create processes for:
<ul>
<li>growing new teams;</li>
<li>splitting large teams;</li>
<li>transitioning to new projects;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="experiment-6-seat-people-on-the-same-team-together-in-a-closed-team-room">Experiment 6: Seat people on the same team together in a closed team room.<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#experiment-6-seat-people-on-the-same-team-together-in-a-closed-team-room"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>100% increase</strong></em> in productivity.</li>
<li>Faster communication and problem-solving.</li>
<li>Fewer external interruptions to the team increase overall productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seat the team in their own room. With walls.</li>
<li>Give at least 5 sqr/meters per person.</li>
<li>Create side rooms for private conversations, phone calls, meetings.</li>
<li>Minimise non-team distractions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="experiment-6-cross-functional-teams-outperform-siloed-teams">Experiment 6: Cross-functional teams outperform siloed teams<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#experiment-6-cross-functional-teams-outperform-siloed-teams"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Produced more effective solutions in the same time.</li>
<li>Much more likely to generate breakthrough solutions.</li>
<li>Short-term loss of negotiation of norms.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fewer external dependencies mean fewer lengthy blockages.</li>
<li>Team has the breadth to see the forest, not just the trees.</li>
<li>Different perspectives mean lower chance of groupthink.</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the team where every skill needed to solve the problem at hand is in the same room.</li>
<li>Limit the charter: “Do everything = big team”.</li>
<li>Fulltime: focused team member efforts. <em><strong>Multitasking = 15% drop in productivity</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="experiment-8-scheduling-at-80-of-team-capacity-produces-better-products">Experiment 8: Scheduling at 80% of team capacity produces better products.<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#experiment-8-scheduling-at-80-of-team-capacity-produces-better-products"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Scheduling at 100% doesn’t give space to creativity.</li>
<li>No lost time: passionate workers keep thinking.</li>
<li>The 20% goes into new idea generation and process improvements.</li>
<li><em><strong>Producing 20 great features is usually far more profitable than 100 competent features</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows employees to explore many options cheaply.</li>
<li>Gives time to prototype breakthrough solutions that sound crazy on paper.</li>
<li><em><strong>Allows people to pursue passions</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule 20% below possible velocity.</li>
<li>Hold periodic reviews of side projects and award interesting ideas.</li>
<li>Publicise and reward side projects that make their way into production.</li>
<li>Keep a public list of important things if anyone runs out of work (happens rarely).</li>
