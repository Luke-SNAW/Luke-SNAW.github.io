<p>We‚Äôve developed a few small projects on Supabase recently as a part of our prospecting process. The developer experience has been delightful, particular <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security">Row Level Security</a>, the more powerful analog to Firestore Rules. That Supabase is betting on <a href="https://deno.com/deploy">Deno</a> for their <a href="https://deno.com/blog/supabase-functions-on-deno-deploy">serverless function suite</a> indicates to us that they are serious about great technology.</p>
<p>We love <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> which Supabase utilizes. We plan to do more research on scalability, since SQL databases can‚Äôt grow as big as their NoSQL counterparts. Nonetheless, Supabase came at the right time.</p>

<p>It's from Google, they deprecate things every 6 months including APIs your app is using, if you don't follow your app will be down pretty quickly. AWS nearly never do breaking changes.</p>

<p>[Firebase founder]</p>
<p>I no longer work at Firebase / Google, but two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There may be issues with the GCP integrations &#x26; UX/DX, but GCP integration is good for many customers and necessary for the future of the business.</p>
<p>One of the common failure modes for the 2011-2014 crop of Backend-as-a-Service offerings was their inability to technically support large customers. The economics of developer tooling are a super-power-law. So, if you hope to pay your employees you'll need to grow with your biggest customers.</p>
<p>Eventually, as they become TheNextBigThing, your biggest customers end up wanting the bells and whistles that only a Big Cloud Platform provide.</p>
<p>This was a part of the reason we chose to join Google, and why the Firebase team really really really pushed hard to integrate with GCP at a project, billing, and product level (philosophy: Firebase exposed the product from the client, GCP from the server) despite all the organizational/political overhead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm excited to see the current crop of app platforms emerge. It has been 10 years since <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3832877">we launched</a> and there are now some great innovations in the space. I like the way <a href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</a> has exposed Postgres and <a href="https://www.instantdb.com/">InstantDB</a> graphdb+realtime is really promising.</p>
