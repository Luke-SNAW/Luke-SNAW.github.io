<li>The author's server was compromised and used to mine Monero for 10 days due to a vulnerability in the Umami analytics tool, which is built with Next.js.</li>
<li>The vulnerability (CVE-2025-66478) was an unsafe deserialization flaw in Next.js's React Server Components' Flight protocol, allowing arbitrary code execution.</li>
<li>Despite the compromise, container isolation prevented the malware from escaping the Umami container and affecting the host system or other containers.</li>

<ul>
<li>Effective writing, especially for experts, is not about adhering to rules but about focusing on the reader and their needs.</li>
<li>Experts often use their writing process to aid their complex thinking, a contrast to journalists who typically use writing to convey pre-formed ideas.</li>
<li>Academic writing should aim to change how readers see the world, rather than simply conveying the writer's own ideas or demonstrating understanding.</li>
<li>Effective academic writing involves understanding and using the 'code' of a specific community of readers to communicate value and persuade them.</li>
<li>Academic conversations are dynamic and evolving, with knowledge being constructed and deconstructed by communities, rather than being a static accumulation of facts.</li>

<li>Middle managers often suppress bad news to appear professional and 'handle problems at their level,' leading to information latency.</li>

<ul>
<li>Descriptive names for software components can be misleading as the scope and purpose of a component can change over time, rendering the original name inaccurate.</li>
<li>Descriptive names create an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_transparency">illusion of transparency</a> rather than true clarity, leading to incorrect assumptions about a component's functionality.</li>
<li>For variables within code that are frequently changed, descriptive names like numCols and numRows are preferable to generic ones like i and j.</li>
<li>When a name serves as an identifier for a complex, long-lived entity, it should be an opaque and immutable identifier, similar to using numerical IDs instead of email addresses as foreign keys in databases.</li>

<li>Avoid the 'Bank Metaphor' in training, which assumes linear progress from effort; instead, focus on specific stimuli to trigger physiological adaptations.</li>
<li>Aerobic training requires 'low and slow' efforts for adaptation, while anaerobic training demands high intensity, necessitating a balance and majority of time spent at a leisurely pace.</li>
<li>Consistency is crucial for long-term improvement, as it signals to the body the need for adaptation and becomes a habit that compounds over time.</li>
<li>Improvements in performance are often gradual and non-linear, making it difficult to 'feel' progress from workout to workout, despite underlying changes.</li>
<li>Focus on mastering fundamental basics rather than seeking quick hacks or tricks for significant and sustainable improvement.</li>
<li>To continue improving, it's essential to step outside your comfort zone and engage in 'desirable difficulties' that challenge you without being overwhelming.</li>

<ul>
<li>If you live in the United States today, and you accidentally knock a hole in your wall, it’s probably cheaper to buy a flatscreen TV and stick it in front of the hole, compared to hiring a handyman to fix your drywall.</li>
<li>The cheapness of air conditioning (a product of technological abundance) contrasts sharply with the rising cost of repairing it (a labor-intensive service immune to such gains), illustrating how technology reshapes value across the economy.</li>
<li>As AI drives productivity in some areas, wages in other sectors will rise, making services like home AC repair more expensive even if the technology for repair hasn't improved.</li>

<li><strong>Task Complexity Matters</strong>: AI is more effective for low-complexity tasks, with productivity gains of 30-40%, compared to 10-15% for high-complexity tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Context Window Limitations</strong>: Even with larger context windows, AI performance decreases as the amount of context increases.</li>
<li><strong>Methodology</strong>: The study used a model that automates the evaluation of code changes, making it scalable and affordable compared to manual expert evaluations.</li>

<p>I swear if I see another "SEO" guy or some rando web dev who joined the workforce after Covid complaining about SPAs by misrepresenting it, I'm gonna explode.<br>
As someone who's been developing web apps since the 2000s, let me tell you the origin of SPA has few things to do with the "false promise of SPAs" he listed, but largely due to companies in the late 2000/early 2010s wanting to go "mobile first". This usually meant they still had a desktop second somewhere, which implied they were architecting the entire system to completely separate the frontends and the backend.</p>
<p>Before, what web devs meant by frontend was essentially server-side rendered HTML templates with perhaps a little bit of jQuery running on the client-side. Now, since mobile and desktop web apps are to share some business logic and the database somehow, people had to rediscover REST by reading Roy Fielding's Phd dissertation that inspired the original HTTP. This meant now every company was moving to service-oriented architecture and started exposing their backend APIs onto the open internet so their mobile apps and SPAs running in the browser can share the same APIs. This was a cost saving measure.</p>
<p>This period also coincided with the steady decline of full-stack webapp frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Django because for a couple of years, these frameworks had no good ways to support an API only applications. Django hadn't even reached 1.0 back then. This was a time when NodeJS was really starting to pick up momentum. Once people had started being more comfortable with JS on the server-side, lots of people suddenly realized they could push a lot of business logic to increasing powerful desktop browsers and phones, application hosts people now call "edge devices".</p>
<p>This is the true impetus of SPA. How is CSS going to kill this need? — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44690219">wyuenho</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The painter who begins with a blank canvas faces more paralysis than the one who starts with a frame and a palette.
One person sets a goal: become a best-selling author. Another imposes a constraint: write every day, but never write what bores me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wut? The constraints are what made it a hard problem, but the only reason they were able to hit this goal in an impossibly short timeline is the huge amount of resources that they put toward a very clear goal (which was, honestly, less "let man explore the heavens" than "beat the Soviets"). — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44237540&#x26;how=un&#x26;auth=51df6f06022c423f1c5abe96dab72810e7a7f3c5&#x26;goto=item%3Fid%3D44232714#44237540">#</a></p>

</ul>
<p>I agree with the author, but I would also say there is something above goals and constraints. Values. A set of things that, when comparing multiple options, make the choice clear. An example of some values I frequently use is "What will give me the most enjoyment the furthest into the future? "What will result in the world being a better place?" "What will make me become someone who resembles Jesus more?" They are different from constraints as they don't knock out any options by default. Instead, they make triaging when there are many different things I could be doing much easier, and circumvent my messy intuition which is based on hormones, hunger, weather, etc.<br>
I think values, goals, and constraints are all valuable, but it's a hierarchy. We should create constraints that help us become more aligned with our values. We should create shorter-term goals that make it easy to stay within our constraints. — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44236709">#</a></p>

Typically, I labored under the delusion that competent technical decision makers would integrate tooling or choose to use a language, "service", platform, whatever, if they saw benefits and if they could make a "case" for why something was the correct approach, i.e how it met some product's needs, addressed some shortcomings, made things more efficient. — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44068694">#</a></p>

<li>EN dashes make a range between things: Boston–San Francisco flight, 10–20 years: both connect not only the endpoints, but define that all the space between is included. (Compare the last usage with the phone number example under Hyphens.)</li>
<li>EM dashes break things, such as sentences or thoughts: 'What the—!'; A paragraph should express one idea—but rules are made to be broken.
