<p>Before we dive in, here are some prerequisites to familiarize yourself with, because we'll use them often in this article.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JavaScript Engine</strong>: A JavaScript engine is simply a computer program that receives JavaScript source code and compiles it to the binary instructions (machine code) that a CPU can understand.</li>
</ul>

<p>The browser's JavaScript engine then creates a special environment to handle the transformation and execution of this JavaScript code. This environment is known as the <code>Execution Context</code>.</p>
<p>The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in its execution.</p>
<p>During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets executed.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global Execution Context (GEC)</li>
<li>Function Execution Context (FEC)</li>
</ul>
