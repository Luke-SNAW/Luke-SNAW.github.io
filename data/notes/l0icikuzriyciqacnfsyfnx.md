> In the end, we decided to go with Playwright, mainly because of its native support for multiple domains, tabs and iFrames.  
> I will say that I found Cypress' debugging to be more developer-friendly and in general "slicker", but that wasn't enough to make us stay put.

### [Cypress vs Other Test Runners](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-vs-other-test-runners/)

Playwright can:

- opens page as page, not in iframe
- emulates mobile devices
- runs against android devices and emulators
- runs tests that cross domains
- works with iframes
- runs tests that span several pages
- uses idiomatic async/await api which is not chained
- uses real browser network stack for routing and mocking
- detects occlusion problems
- selector expressiveness is unprecedented: https://playwright.dev/docs...
- tests pages with out-of-process iframes
- tests Web Workers
- tests Web Sockets
- tests Service Workers

### [Web Automation: Don't Use Selenium, Use Playwright](https://new.pythonforengineers.com/blog/web-automation-dont-use-selenium-use-playwright/)

The killer feature of Playwright is: You can [automatically generate tests](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/codegen-intro) by opening a web browser and manually running through the steps you want.
