<p>I wrote a lot of rust, but after some years it still feels unproductive. I do a lot of zig now and I am like 10 times more productive with it. I can just concentrate on what I want to code and I never have to wonder what tool or what library to use.</p>
<p>I know rust gives memory safety and how important that is, but the ergonomic is really bad. Every time I write some rust I feel limited. I always have to search libraries and how to do things. I cannot just "type the code".</p>
<p>Also the type system can get out of control, it can be very hard to actually know what method you can call on a struct.</p>
<p>I still think rust is a great tool, and that it solves tons of problem. But I do not think it is a good general purpose language.</p>

<p>Opposite experience for me. Writing Rust on embedded systems greatly improved my confidence and speed. When using C a small mistake often leads to undefined behaviour and headaches. Rust theres none of that - its been a game changer for me.</p>
