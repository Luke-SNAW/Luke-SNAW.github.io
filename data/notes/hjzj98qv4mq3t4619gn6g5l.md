## Why Not Password and Sessions?

1. **Scalability**: Managing session states across multiple servers or microservices can be time-consuming and inefficient.
2. **Performance**: Constantly verifying session information with each request adds overhead, impacting application performance.
3. **Security Risks**: Sessions can be vulnerable to various attacks, such as session hijacking and cross-site scripting (XSS).

Token-based authentication addresses these issues by offering a **stateless approach**. Each token encapsulates the user's identity and permissions, eliminating the need for the server to maintain the session state. This approach doesnâ€™t just simplify the architecture but also enhances security.

## **Challenges in Using Tokens**

While token-based authentication offers numerous advantages, it also comes with its own challenges that developers must navigate.

1. **Token Management**: Securely storing and managing tokens, especially refresh tokens, is crucial. Poorly managed tokens can become a security liability.
2. **Token Expiration**: Implementing and handling token expiration requires careful thought to balance security and user experience.
3. **Scalability and Performance**: In high-traffic systems, validating tokens for each request can become a performance bottleneck.
4. **Cross-Domain/Cross-Origin Issues**: When tokens are used across different domains, developers need to handle potential CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues.
