Many drawing tutorials show us **how** to draw things.

They teach us how to make photo-like drawings. Such renderings look decent but also generic, conventional—like something an AI tool might produce.

And they are also… 

**boring**.

Why is that?

Because they don’t **mean** anything.

## Meaning

An object, like a cup, can mean many **different things** to us.

Now the question is: **Which meaning is relevant to you right now?**

And the answer to this question is what makes your drawing interesting. You just need to show it.

But how?

## Composition

We must understand that a [drawing is very different](https://ralphammer.com/what-is-a-picture/) from the real thing. For instance, a picture can only show **one view**. So we have to pick the **best view of the object** and decide **where to put it** within the bounds of our paper.

Or in other words: We need to **compose** the picture. 

And this composition will have a drastic impact on **how the object appears** to us.

## Principles

There are no strict rules on how to do this. Instead, artists and designers prefer to speak of **principles** that can guide our decisions. 

Here is a selection of my favourites:

## Space

[space](https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/05_space.png)

We see the picture plane as an **enclosed space with its own rules**.

## Gravity

[gravity](https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/06_gravity.png)

These rules are in part shaped by our perceptual habits. For example we **impose our experience of physical laws** on the shapes we see in a picture. Big shapes at the bottom seem to be “heavy”.

## Relation

[relation](https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/07_relation.png)

Just as we recognize **relationships** between things, animals and people in the real world, we see them in visual elements as well.

## Chaos & order

[chaos & order](https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/08_chaosorder.png)

And since we are always searching for **rules that structure our surroundings** we enjoy regular patterns. They give us [a soothing sense of an understandable order](https://ralphammer.com/immanuel-kant-beauty/).

## Contrast

[contrast](https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/09_contrast.png)

When individual forms **stand out** from the rest, we notice them first. They seem more important. This is how we can create **visible hierarchies**.

## Perspective

[perspective](https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10_perspective.png)

We can also pick a view point in our picture space to **suggest a physical relationship** to the objects. For example, a thing can appear “bigger than me” or “above me”.

## Depth

[depth](https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/11_depth.png)

In this way, we can also suggest **spatial depth**, which implies **a sense of time**. What is close appears “urgent”, things that are farther away “come later”.

## Harmony

[harmony](https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/12_harmony.png)

Harmony in a composition suggests that **everything is fine**. The extreme case is perfect symmetry. Yet we can also position elements of different sizes carefully to retain a sense of **balance**.

## Movement

[movement](https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/13_movement.png)

And finally, linear arrangements can **suggest movement** and bring static images to life.

## Process

We can use these principles to show a particular meaning. However, this requires that we are clear about **why** we want to draw that thing in the first place.

[Why to draw something](https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/14_why.gif)

But even with a clear goal in mind, the workflow to our composition is rarely straightforward. Like many creative processes, image composition can be messy and unpredictable.

[composition process](https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/15_process.gif)

Most of the time, we **try out many variations** to gradually work our way toward a solution.

## Every drawing is a self portrait

Of course there are more choices to be made about colour, style or [what type of image](https://ralphammer.com/show-me/) to create. Yet, I am convinced that composition remains the primary decision. It is the key to **intriguing and authentic drawings** that show more than just lifeless renderings.

[interesting variations](https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/16_interesting.png)

Carefully composed drawings can show **our relation to the world**. 

And **that** is interesting.

It is interesting because we have made a conscious choice of **what is important to us**. And chances are that this is **also interesting for others**. 

So to bring your drawings to the next level—after learning **how** to draw something—is to show **why** you draw it. And then, perhaps your drawing makes us see something **in a new way**: your way.
