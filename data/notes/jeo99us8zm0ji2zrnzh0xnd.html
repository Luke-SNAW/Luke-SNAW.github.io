<hr>
<p>I have started doing something completely different than using bookmarks. I set up yacy<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> on a personal, internal server at my home, which I can access from all my devices, since they are always on my wireguard vpn.</p>
<p>Yacy is actually a distributed search engine, but I run in 'Robinson mode' as a private peer, to keep it isolated, as I just want a personal search of only sites I have indexed.</p>
<p>Anytime I come across something of interest, I index it with yacy, using a a depth of 0 (since I only want to index that one page, not the whole site). This way, I can just go to my search site, and search for something, and anything related that I've indexed before pops up. I found this works way better than trying to manage bookmarks with descriptions and tags.</p>
<p>Also, yacy will keep a cache of the content which is great if the site ever goes offline or changes.</p>
<p>If I need to browse, I can go use yacy's admin tools to see all the urls I have indexed.</p>
<p>I have been using this for several months and I am using this way more than I ever used my bookmarks.</p>
