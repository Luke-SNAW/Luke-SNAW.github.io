<p>The proposal <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator#tacit-unary-function-application-syntax">“Pipe operator (|>) for JavaScript”</a> (by J. S. Choi, James DiGioia, Ron Buckton and Tab Atkins) introduces a new operator.</p>
<hr>
<p>There originally were two competing proposals for a pipe operator, inspired by other programming languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>F# by Microsoft is a functional programming language whose core is based on OCaml. This pipe operator works together well with curried functions (I’ll explain what that is soon).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hack by Facebook is – roughly – a statically typed version of PHP. This pipe operator focuses on language features other than curried functions. It includes syntactic support for partial application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter proposal won. However, if you prefer the F# pipe, there is good news: Its benefits may be added to the Hack pipe at a later time (details are explained later).</p>
