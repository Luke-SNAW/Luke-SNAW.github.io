<li>A year ago i had to develop a big Java application without orm (cto’s choice): i didn’t remember how tedious, error prone and slow is development without orm!!! Never do it again!</li>
<li>I think the best approach is to use orm for common crud tasks and add specific sql queries when things get a little bit complicated.

<blockquote>
<p>Knex.js (and other query builders) was designed to be a building block for ORMs; it does not add value when majority of the query is static.<br>
I recommend that you use a query builder for those few queries that need to be generated dynamically, and use raw SQL for everything else. It is not one or the other; the two work together.</p>

<ul>
<li>SQLite does not support subscriptions which can be a limitation on certain real-time use cases. However, there are plenty of reasons to recommend against using database subscriptions for real-time use cases anyway. Scaling real-time use cases is quite challenging, and personally have really enjoyed letting <a href="https://www.partykit.io/">Partykit</a> do that part for me in my apps.</li>
<li>SQLite being a file on disk does make connecting from external clients effectively impossible. But with <a href="http://fly.io/">Fly.io</a> at least, it’s easy to run prisma studio on the production server and proxy that for local access. If you need to connect to it from another app, then you’re out of luck and have to set up HTTP endpoints on the host app for any data you need (<a href="https://github.com/superfly/litefs/issues/326">for now</a>).</li>
<li>SQLite does not support plugins like <a href="https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb">TimescaleDB</a> for Postgres. While time-series data is possible with SQLite, I do not have experience with this use case and can't speak to the challenges there. My intuition says it's not advisable to use SQLite for that use case, but maybe someone else can offer me more insight.</li>
<li>SQLite does not support enums which means you're forced to use strings. I have mixed feelings about this, but I mostly don't like enums anyway. The main drawback to this is when it comes to the typings for the client which doesn't allow you to ensure all values of a column are only within a set of specific possible values for the string. However, with Prisma client extensions, handling this kind of enforcement at the client (and typing) level <a href="https://github.com/L-Steinmacher/epic-stack-with-prisma-client-extensions">is possible</a>.</li>
