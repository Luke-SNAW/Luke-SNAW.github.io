# [Google Tag Manager, the new anti-adblock weapon](https://chromium.woolyss.com/f/HTML-Google-Tag-Manager-the-new-anti-adblock-weapon.html)

The "Server-Side Tagging" version of the Google tool allows you to bypass browser and other adblocker protections

Google Tag Manager is a TMS (Tag Management System): it allows marketing teams to add trackers to a website or application, without having to go through developers. Via a web interface, these teams can decide:

- Tracers to be triggered (analytics, A / B testing, attribution, etc.).
- Trigger conditions (categories of pages, user characteristics, etc.).
- Data to be transmitted to these third-party tools (user characteristics, navigation data, variables present on the page, etc.).

Google Tag Manager is present on 31.9% of the top 10 million Alexa websites, according to W3Techs, but above all Google Tag Manager has a 99.4% market share on TMS (!)
