<p>Now that the most important stuff is out of the way, let's take a closer look at what you're actually supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this guide, these have three characteristics. First, learning how to work in a team is a goal of the course. This distinguishes these courses from (for example) upper-level courses in operating systems or computer graphics, in which you're working in a team but not being taught explicitly how to do so.</p>
<p>Second, your grade depends primarily on the software you build. You may also be required to write reports and sit an exam, but these are based on the practical workâ€”if you don't actually build some software, you can't pass the course.</p>
<p>Finally, you are supposed to work as if you were trying to meet the needs of a real customer. You might start with a blank sheet of paper or have to fix and extend an existing application; either way, you and your team are responsible for some or all of requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, documentation, packaging, deployment, handoff, and review.</p>
<h2 id="why-projects">Why Projects?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-projects"></a></h2>
<p>Project courses exist for several reasons:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>To teach you things that can only be learned by doing</strong></dt>
  <dd>If you pursue a career in industry, or if you go stay in academia and do anything other than pure theory, you will need to know how to build things. This is a craft, not a science: you can't learn how by listening to lectures any more than you can learn to ride a bike by watching the Tour de France on TV.</dd>
  <dt><strong>To tie everything you've learned together</strong></dt>
  <dd>i.e., to demonstrate that the trees and pointers and joins and semaphores you've been wrestling with for the last two or three years are actually good for something.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Because they're fun</strong></dt>
  <dd>At least, if they're done right.</dd>
