<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You want to delete records, but also want to retain them for n number of days, just for a safer side against accidental deletion.</li>
<li>You want to exclude some records (permanent retain) under explicit requirements, even if they match the criteria of an eligible record to be deleted.</li>
<li>You don't want to delete the actual resource before returning the resource back. Basically, deletion before returning the value is not desired.</li>
<li>You don't want to modify existing table schema(s) to accommodate soft delete key.</li>
<li>You want the tables as loosely coupled as possible without having to worry about deletion logic.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Composite indexes are about 10x faster than index merges. In Postgres, the gap is larger than in MySQL because Postgres doesn't support index-only scans for queries that involve index merges.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why are you not using a database that does sharding for you? Over the past few years the so-called “serverless” database has gotten a lot more traction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the most important paragraph in the article. In a world where things like Dynamo/Cassandra or Spanner/Cockroach exist, manually-sharded DB solutions are pretty much entirely obsolete. Spanner exists because Google got so sick of people building and maintaining bespoke solutions for replication and resharding, which would inevitably have their own set of quirks, bugs, consistency gaps, scaling limits, and manual operations required to reshard or rebalance from time to time. When it's part of the database itself, all those problems just... disappear. It's like a single database that just happens to spread itself across multiple machines. It's an actual distributed cloud solution.<br>
My current employer uses sharded and replicated Postgres via RDS. Even basic things like deploying schema changes to every shard are an unbelievable pain in the ass, and changing the number of shards on a major database is a high-touch, multi-day operation. After having worked with Spanner in the past, it's like going back to the stone age, like we're only a step above babysitting individual machines in a closet. Nobody should do this. — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35478332">GeneralMayhem</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Essentially the ORM can handle about 80-90% of the mapping problems, but that last chunk always needs careful work by somebody who really understands how a relational database works.<br>
... A framework that allows me to avoid 80% of that is worthwhile even if it is only 80%.<br>
To avoid the mapping problem you have two alternatives. Either you use the relational model in memory, or you don't use it in the database.</p>
