<li>Users typically only utilize about 20% of an application's features, and <strong>this 20% varies from user to user</strong>.</li>
<li>Software often becomes bloated with features that most users don't need, leading to frustration and resentment.</li>
<li>VS Code, Slack, and Discord exemplify platforms that provide a foundation for users to customize their experience.</li>
<li>Accepting that users will only partially care about your software can lead to more focused and satisfying product development.</li>
<li>Embracing the idea that software will be used in unexpected ways can lead to innovative and user-centric design.</li>
