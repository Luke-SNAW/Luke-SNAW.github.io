Most of these problems shared a few things in common:

- Things didn’t break completely, they just degraded. That’s probably the right call, but it meant that I didn’t immediately notice there was a problem.
- Compounding this, I had no idea how well the device “should” work, so I took a long time to notice that it was in a degraded state.
- Even once I was aware of the problem, it was hard or impossible to understand the root cause and fix it because I didn’t know the right diagnostics (or they didn’t exist).
