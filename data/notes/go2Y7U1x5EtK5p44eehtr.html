<p>Is there an eli5 or similar on the differences between podman / docker / rancher / others?</p>
<p>Podman is for running containers on a single host. It's exactly like docker with a few additional features (like the ability to run rootless containers and run containers in something like a Kubernetes pod). Podman was developed by Red Hat to replace docker, the cli, because Docker, the company, didn't play very nice with the open source community.<br>
Rancher is a Kubernetes implementation that can run containers across multiple hosts. Rancher is more comparable to something like Red Hat OpenShift or Hashicorp Nomad than docker.</p>
