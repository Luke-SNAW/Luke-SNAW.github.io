<p>You must install and update them manually, making it harder to use them across devices.</p>
<p>We needed a platform that allows us to build a product once and deliver it to all customers regardless of their platform of choice. The browser fits this description perfectly.</p>
<p>We can build an application once, and it will be available on every machine with a network connection. Updates are a matter of refreshing the page, and the team required to maintain it will be significantly smaller.</p>
<p>But there’s one problem.</p>
