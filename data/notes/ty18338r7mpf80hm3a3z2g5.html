<p>Summing up, Maps are similar to Objects in that they hold key/value pairs, but Maps have several advantages over objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Size - Maps have a size property, whereas Objects do not have a built-in way to retrieve their size.</li>
<li>Iteration - Maps are directly iterable, whereas Objects are not.</li>
<li>Flexibility - Maps can have any data type (primitive or Object) as the key to a value, while Objects can only have strings.</li>
<li>Ordered - Maps retain their insertion order, whereas objects do not have a guaranteed order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to these factors, Maps are a powerful data structure to consider. However, Objects haves some important advantages as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>JSON - Objects work flawlessly with JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify(), two essential functions for working with JSON, a common data format that many REST APIs deal with.</li>
<li>Working with a single element - Working with a known value in an Object, you can access it directly with the key without the need to use a method, such as Map's get().</li>
</ul>
<p>This list will help you decide if a Map or Object is the right data structure for your use case.</p>
