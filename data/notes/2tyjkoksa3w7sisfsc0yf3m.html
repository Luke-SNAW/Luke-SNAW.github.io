<p><strong>6 drawing exercises to get you started right now!</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>basic craft of drawing</strong> is about two things: you learn <strong>to control your hand</strong> and <strong>to see</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Tip: For the following 6 exercises I suggest you <strong>stick with one pen and one particular type of paper</strong> (for instance A5).</em></p>
<h2 id="dexterity--two-workouts">Dexterity — two workouts<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dexterity--two-workouts"></a></h2>
<p>The first two exercises are about controlling your hand. We want to <strong>build muscles</strong> and train our <strong>hand-eye-coordination</strong>. Mechanical exercises like these are great for beginners. Later on you might use them to <strong>explore new pens</strong> or get started <strong>when you don’t know what to draw</strong> yet.</p>
<p>They are also terrific ways to relax your mind.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-1-circles--more-is-more">Exercise 1: Circles — more is more!<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#exercise-1-circles--more-is-more"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Distribute circles of various sizes on a piece of paper until the paper is filled. Make sure the circles do not overlap.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_2.gif" alt="circle packing"></p>
<p>Drawing circles is not as easy as you might think. Notice how the circles become harder, the bigger you make them? Try them in both directions — and make lots of them.</p>
<p><em>Tip: <strong>Shake your hand</strong> when it starts cramping! This is a workout for our hands after all.</em></p>
<h3 id="exercise-2-hatching--the-joy-of-structure">Exercise 2: Hatching — the joy of structure<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#exercise-2-hatching--the-joy-of-structure"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Fill a piece of paper with parallel lines.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_4.gif" alt="hatching"></p>
<p>Diagonal lines come easiest for us because <strong>they comply to the motion of our wrist</strong>. Did you notice how left-handed people prefer the opposite direction than right-handed people? Have a look at drawings by your favourite draughtswoman or draughtsman (in my case: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonardo</a>), and guess which hand they used!</p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_5.gif" alt="hatching"></p>
<p><strong>Now make sure to try other directions as well</strong>. Have fun! Combine various hatchings and enjoy watching the darkness spread on your paper.</p>
<p><em>Tip: <strong>Don’t rotate the paper</strong>. The whole point here is to train your hand to get comfortable with all directions.</em></p>
<p><strong>So now that we have worked our hands a little, let’s train our eyes!</strong></p>
<h2 id="perception--learning-to-see">Perception — learning to see<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#perception--learning-to-see"></a></h2>
<p>Drawing is mainly about <a href="http://ralphammer.com/seeing-vs-reading/"><strong>seeing and understanding what you see</strong></a>. People often assume that everybody sees the same, but actually seeing is a skill which you can improve. <strong>The more you draw, the more you see</strong>. The next four exercises will <strong>make you see more</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-3-contour--show-me-your-hands">Exercise 3: Contour — Show me your hands!<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#exercise-3-contour--show-me-your-hands"></a></h3>
<p><strong>You see all those fascinating contours of your hand? Collect them on a piece of paper! Don’t try to draw the whole hand yet, just pick some of those lovely lines.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_6.gif" alt="hand drawings"></p>
<p>Whether you draw a person, a plant, or your favourite animal, it is usually the <strong>contours</strong> that define a body or object and make others <strong>recognise</strong> them. The challenge is less to draw those distinctive lines but rather <strong>to see them</strong> in the first place!</p>
<p><strong>Even if you think you already know the shape of an object, it is always worth to take a closer look and rediscover it.</strong></p>
<h3 id="exercise-4-chiaroscuro--folding-light-and-darkness">Exercise 4: Chiaroscuro — folding light and darkness<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#exercise-4-chiaroscuro--folding-light-and-darkness"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Arrange and draw a piece of cloth. Start with the contours and then — using your hatching skills — create an interplay of light und darkness.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_7.gif" alt="cloth drawings"></p>
<p>This exercise gives you a sense for light and darkness. I have to admit it is not the easiest and might as well be part of an advanced tutorial. Keep in mind: <strong>This one is not about getting it perfectly “right”</strong>. The cloth is a playground to try out those various hatchings you have practised before and feel how you can create light and shadows with your — almost — bare hands!</p>
<p><em>Tip: You can use <strong>curved hatching</strong> to modulate the shapes, and <strong>crosshatching</strong> to achieve darker areas that resemble woven structures.</em></p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_8.gif" alt="curved hatching"></p>
<p><em>Tip: Close your eyes just a little bit when you look at the cloth. You will see everything blurred, but you will also <strong>see an enhanced contrast between light and dark</strong>.</em></p>
<p>The arrangement of light is a great way to <strong>show what is important</strong> in a picture. Just have a look at paintings by <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt_van_Rijn">Rembrandt</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_de_La_Tour">Georges de la Tour</a>. And the next time you watch a movie look out for dramatic effects achieved with light and shadow.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-5-perspective--lost-in-space">Exercise 5: Perspective — lost in space<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#exercise-5-perspective--lost-in-space"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Let’s draw some cubes! Just follow the simple steps below.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_10.gif" alt="perspective cubes"></p>
<p>Perspective drawing is basically a <strong>projection of a 3D environment on a 2D surface</strong> (your piece of paper).</p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_11.gif" alt="perspective explained"></p>
<p>Constructing perspective drawings is a bit of a science and cannot be covered in detail within the attention span of an online article. Nevertheless we can have some fun with <strong>a simple technique</strong> that gives us <strong>an intuitive feel</strong> for the magic of perspective drawing:</p>
<p><em><strong>Step 1</strong></em>: Draw a horizontal line. This is the <strong>horizon</strong> of your picture.</p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_12.gif"></p>
<p><em><strong>Step 2</strong></em>: Define two points on the horizon near the edge of the paper. These are your two vanishing points.</p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_13.gif"></p>
<p><em><strong>Step 3</strong></em>: Draw a vertical line somewhere.</p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_14.gif"></p>
<p><em><strong>Step 4</strong></em>: Connect the endpoints of the vertical line with the vanishing points.</p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_15.gif"></p>
<p><em><strong>Step 5</strong></em>: Add two vertical lines like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_16.gif"></p>
<p><em><strong>Step 6</strong></em>: Connect them with the vanishing points.</p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_17.gif"></p>
<p><em><strong>Step 7</strong></em>: Now use a dark pencil or pen to emphasise the cube. Voilà!</p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_18.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Repeat steps 3–7 as often as you like</strong>. Have fun! If you feel adventurous you might even hatch the sides of the cubes.</p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_19.gif"></p>
<p><em>Tip: When you draw lines that meet, it is usually a good idea to be confident and <strong>let them overlap a little bit</strong>. The shapes will look better defined.</em></p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_20.gif"></p>
<p>Mastering perspective drawings will give you the power to create illusions of depth. But most importantly, <strong>you teach your brain how to think in three dimensions</strong>. So even if you choose to draw “flat” drawings or mess with the “rules” of perspective — which I like to do — <strong>to understand perspective drawing is still one of the most precious drawing skills you can learn</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-6-composition--why-is-this-there">Exercise 6: Composition — Why is this there?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#exercise-6-composition--why-is-this-there"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Make 5 different drawings of an object. Arrange the object differently on the paper each time!</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_21.gif" alt="composition exercise"></p>
<p>Composition is a great tool to <strong>“say” something with a drawing</strong>, to <strong>shape its meaning or message</strong>.</p>
<p>To understand how it works we have to bear in mind that our perception has been <strong>shaped by everyday experiences</strong>. For instance horizontal and vertical lines seem more “stable” to us than diagonals, which might “fall over” any second. And when we see a big dark shape at the bottom we somehow assume it must be “heavy”.</p>
<p><img src="http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_22.gif"></p>
<p>As you try different arrangements of your subject on a piece of paper, notice how this changes their connotations — their meaning.</p>
