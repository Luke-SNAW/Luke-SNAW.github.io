<blockquote>
<p>I'm mid-40's, and at every medium-to-large company I have worked at, each promotion == more meetings, more bureaucracy, and less coding. Developing software is where the fun is, so for me the best route has been working at very small startups.
Essentially no meetings and I design and build stuff all day every day and it's great.</p>
