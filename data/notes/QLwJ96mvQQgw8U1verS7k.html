<p>Does your team do local dev?<br>
Every team I've known that adopted Lambda + DynamoDB (or equivalents) gave up on running their app locally, adding a lot of friction to the development process.</p>

<p>I highly recommend using AWS's own Chalice library as it makes local dev <em>and</em> deployment very easy.</p>
<p>If you need more complex cases like deploying docker containers to a Lambda function, take a look at AWS's SAM library. Also supports local dev <em>and</em> makes deployment easy (its essentially a wrapper around Cloudformation so its very powerful).</p>
