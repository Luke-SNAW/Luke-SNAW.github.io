<p>Life is short and your project is even shorter, so this book focuses on the things that will help you the most in the short term:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to work effectively in a small team when you are constantly being interrupted by other tasks like the homework for your other courses.</li>
<li>What tools you should use to build, test, deploy, and describe software in less time and with less pain.</li>
<li>How to design a program (or a set of related programs) that will take several weeks to write.</li>
<li>How a few simple changes in your study habits will enable you to learn more and more quickly.</li>
<li>What legal rights you have to the software you create as a student (and on the job).</li>
<li>What to do when things go wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have included other material as well, since there is a lot of variation between project courses and even more between the people doing them. Throughout, we are guided by a modified version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_in_Biology_Makes_Sense_Except_in_the_Light_of_Evolution">Dobzhansky's Rule</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing in software engineering makes sense except in the light of psychology.</p>
