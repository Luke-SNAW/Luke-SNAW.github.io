<p>Many drawing tutorials show us <strong>how</strong> to draw things.</p>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01_instruction.png">instruction to draw cup</a></p>
<p>They teach us how to make photo-like drawings. Such renderings look decent but also generic, conventional—like something an AI tool might produce.</p>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/02_boring.png">drawing of a cup</a></p>
<p>And they are also… </p>
<p><strong>boring</strong>.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because they don’t <strong>mean</strong> anything.</p>
<h2 id="meaning">Meaning<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#meaning"></a></h2>
<p>An object, like a cup, can mean many <strong>different things</strong> to us.</p>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/03_meaning.gif">meanings of a cup</a></p>
<p>Now the question is: <strong>Which meaning is relevant to you right now?</strong></p>
<p>And the answer to this question is what makes your drawing interesting. You just need to show it.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<h2 id="composition">Composition<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#composition"></a></h2>
<p>We must understand that a <a href="https://ralphammer.com/what-is-a-picture/">drawing is very different</a> from the real thing. For instance, a picture can only show <strong>one view</strong>. So we have to pick the <strong>best view of the object</strong> and decide <strong>where to put it</strong> within the bounds of our paper.</p>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_composition.gif">compositions of a cup</a></p>
<p>Or in other words: We need to <strong>compose</strong> the picture. </p>
<p>And this composition will have a drastic impact on <strong>how the object appears</strong> to us.</p>
<h2 id="principles">Principles<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#principles"></a></h2>
<p>There are no strict rules on how to do this. Instead, artists and designers prefer to speak of <strong>principles</strong> that can guide our decisions. </p>
<p>Here is a selection of my favourites:</p>
<h2 id="space">Space<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#space"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/05_space.png">space</a></p>
<p>We see the picture plane as an <strong>enclosed space with its own rules</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="gravity">Gravity<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#gravity"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/06_gravity.png">gravity</a></p>
<p>These rules are in part shaped by our perceptual habits. For example we <strong>impose our experience of physical laws</strong> on the shapes we see in a picture. Big shapes at the bottom seem to be “heavy”.</p>
<h2 id="relation">Relation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#relation"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/07_relation.png">relation</a></p>
<p>Just as we recognize <strong>relationships</strong> between things, animals and people in the real world, we see them in visual elements as well.</p>
<h2 id="chaos--order">Chaos &#x26; order<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chaos--order"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/08_chaosorder.png">chaos &#x26; order</a></p>
<p>And since we are always searching for <strong>rules that structure our surroundings</strong> we enjoy regular patterns. They give us <a href="https://ralphammer.com/immanuel-kant-beauty/">a soothing sense of an understandable order</a>.</p>
<h2 id="contrast">Contrast<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#contrast"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/09_contrast.png">contrast</a></p>
<p>When individual forms <strong>stand out</strong> from the rest, we notice them first. They seem more important. This is how we can create <strong>visible hierarchies</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="perspective">Perspective<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#perspective"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10_perspective.png">perspective</a></p>
<p>We can also pick a view point in our picture space to <strong>suggest a physical relationship</strong> to the objects. For example, a thing can appear “bigger than me” or “above me”.</p>
<h2 id="depth">Depth<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#depth"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/11_depth.png">depth</a></p>
<p>In this way, we can also suggest <strong>spatial depth</strong>, which implies <strong>a sense of time</strong>. What is close appears “urgent”, things that are farther away “come later”.</p>
<h2 id="harmony">Harmony<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#harmony"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/12_harmony.png">harmony</a></p>
<p>Harmony in a composition suggests that <strong>everything is fine</strong>. The extreme case is perfect symmetry. Yet we can also position elements of different sizes carefully to retain a sense of <strong>balance</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="movement">Movement<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#movement"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/13_movement.png">movement</a></p>
<p>And finally, linear arrangements can <strong>suggest movement</strong> and bring static images to life.</p>
<h2 id="process">Process<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#process"></a></h2>
<p>We can use these principles to show a particular meaning. However, this requires that we are clear about <strong>why</strong> we want to draw that thing in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/14_why.gif">Why to draw something</a></p>
<p>But even with a clear goal in mind, the workflow to our composition is rarely straightforward. Like many creative processes, image composition can be messy and unpredictable.</p>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/15_process.gif">composition process</a></p>
<p>Most of the time, we <strong>try out many variations</strong> to gradually work our way toward a solution.</p>
<h2 id="every-drawing-is-a-self-portrait">Every drawing is a self portrait<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#every-drawing-is-a-self-portrait"></a></h2>
<p>Of course there are more choices to be made about colour, style or <a href="https://ralphammer.com/show-me/">what type of image</a> to create. Yet, I am convinced that composition remains the primary decision. It is the key to <strong>intriguing and authentic drawings</strong> that show more than just lifeless renderings.</p>
<p><a href="https://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/16_interesting.png">interesting variations</a></p>
<p>Carefully composed drawings can show <strong>our relation to the world</strong>. </p>
<p>And <strong>that</strong> is interesting.</p>
<p>It is interesting because we have made a conscious choice of <strong>what is important to us</strong>. And chances are that this is <strong>also interesting for others</strong>. </p>
<p>So to bring your drawings to the next level—after learning <strong>how</strong> to draw something—is to show <strong>why</strong> you draw it. And then, perhaps your drawing makes us see something <strong>in a new way</strong>: your way.</p>
