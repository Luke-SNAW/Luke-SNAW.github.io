<p>I ask these indirectly.</p>
<p>"What types of people tend to succeed and do well with your team? What types of people tend to struggle in your team?"
(Am I going to be a culture and work/life balance fit?)</p>
<p>"What are your main objectives in the next 6 to 12 months? What's your plan to meet those objectives?"
(Do these guys have their act together and an actual plan? Is the work going to be interesting?)</p>
<p>"How do you see the candidate in this role contributing to that objective?"
(Are their expectations for this role realistic? Do I fit those expectations? Do I want to be on that ride?)</p>
<p>"Tell me about how the team collaborates and coordinates work"
(Am I going to be stuck in 1 hour all-hands daily "stand-ups" every day?)</p>
