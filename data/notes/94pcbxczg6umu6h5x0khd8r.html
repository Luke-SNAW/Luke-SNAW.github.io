<ul>
<li>React (re)renders your component when:
<ul>
<li>there is a state update scheduled by your component
<ul>
<li>including updates scheduled by custom hooks your component consumes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the parent component got rendered and your component doesn’t meet the criteria for bailing out on re-rendering, where all these four conditions have to be satisfied at the same time:
<ul>
<li>Your component has been rendered before i.e. it already mounted</li>
<li>No props (referentially) changed</li>
<li>No any context value consumed by your component changed</li>
<li>Your component itself didn’t schedule an update</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You probably shouldn’t need to worry about seemingly unnecessary re-renders until it becomes a performance issue. Check out the flow chart I made for solutions you can adopt when a performance issue occurs.</li>
</ul>
