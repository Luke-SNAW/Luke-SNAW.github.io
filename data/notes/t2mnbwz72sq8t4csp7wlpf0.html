<ul>
<li>Descriptive names for software components can be misleading as the scope and purpose of a component can change over time, rendering the original name inaccurate.</li>
<li>Descriptive names create an illusion of transparency rather than true clarity, leading to incorrect assumptions about a component's functionality.</li>
<li>For variables within code that are frequently changed, descriptive names like numCols and numRows are preferable to generic ones like i and j.</li>
<li>When a name serves as an identifier for a complex, long-lived entity, it should be an opaque and immutable identifier, similar to using numerical IDs instead of email addresses as foreign keys in databases.</li>
</ul>

<p>I often see this call to action: “Please, engineers, name your services/repos/libraries more descriptively!
No. Unironically, no. This is a bad idea.
I’m probably being overdramatic there, but I hope my point is clear. “Descriptive” names don’t create transparency, they create the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_transparency">illusion of transparency.</a> If you see that something has the name OrderStatusService, you will instinctively assume you know what it is and does, and you will probably be wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[django-htmlmin](https://github.com/cobrateam/django-htmlmin)</code>: HTML minifier for Python frameworks (not only Django, despite the name).</li>
<li><code>[plugin-update-checker](https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker)</code>: Despite the name, it also works with themes.</li>
<li><code>[svox2](https://github.com/sxyu/svox2/blob/master/README.md)</code>: Despite the name, it’s not strictly intended to be a successor of svox.</li>
<li><code>[CO_Cron](https://github.com/ColoradoDemography/CO_Cron)</code>: Despite the name, uses node-schedule rather than cron.</li>
<li><code>[TensorFlow Infra Validator](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/infra_validator.md)</code>: Despite the name, does not validate the infrastructure being used to run TensorFlow.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Even worse are those ubiquitous diagrams everybody uses to communicate about software, where there’s a box labeled OrdersService with an arrow connecting it to a box labeled OrderStatusService. I don’t understand why anybody draws those. You can just say “The Orders Service asynchronously pushes order ids, ETAs, and statuses to the Order Status Service.” If you draw a diagram instead, anybody who wants to believe that the data flows in the other direction, or is synchronous, or is different data, will look at the diagram and see confirmation.)</p>
<p>Now, if a name is going to be easily changeable forever, please do make it descriptive. I’d much rather maintain code where the variables look like numCols and numRows than i and j. (Just, for the love of God, if you change the meaning, also change the name). But if a name is going to serve as, in any sense, an identifier, something that will point at a big complicated thing from many places far away, make it an opaque identifier. You get similar advice in database schema design — if your user’s email address can change, don’t use their email address as a foreign key in your database. Use a number or a random string instead. Something immutable.</p>
