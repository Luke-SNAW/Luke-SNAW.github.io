<p>The only real solution to this problem (that I know of, anyway) is the notion of <strong>stacked PRs</strong>. Here's the basic idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a pull request from a feature branch (say feature-1) to master</li>
<li>Create a second pull request from another feature branch (say feature-2) to feature-1</li>
<li>Repeat until you have a stack of pull requests</li>
<li>When it's time to merge, start from the topmost PR (the one that's furthest from master) and merge/rebase every PR in until you merge the entire stack in to master</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="benefits">Benefits<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#benefits"></a></h1>
<p>After having used the stacked PR workflow for a while, the benefits are readily apparent:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dependencies: Changes that your feature depends on (but are otherwise unrelated) can go in a separate PR.</li>
<li>Reviewers: Every PR in the stack can potentially be assigned to a different set of reviewers, which can be helpful in a few different contexts - ramping, areas of expertise, or workload.</li>
<li>Incremental approval: Large, thorny changes can be approved in pieces.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="tradeoffs">Tradeoffs<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#tradeoffs"></a></h1>
<p>The stacked PR workflow in general can be very useful, but it isn't a silver bullet. There are concerns &#x26; tradeoffs to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can't create a stack of pull requests if you're on a fork.</li>
<li>Force-pushes are pretty much a requirement, so this doesn't work well for collaborative feature branches.</li>
<li>There's more initial overhead for the author; it's a lot easier (at first, anyway) to stick the entire change in the single PR.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion"></a></h1>
<p>Ultimately, stacking PRs is just another tool to help manage GitHub-based code review. I've found that it works well for large changes (4+ PRs), but small-to-medium changes are generally better off as commits on a single PR. There's undoubtedly some discretion that needs to be applied here, but don't be afraid to use a stack of PRs if the situation calls for it!</p>
<p>The tooling situation is not great, admittedly. I haven't found another tool that does what <code>gh-stack</code> does, and there's a lot of room for improvement there. I'm also hoping for <a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1170804894241972224">something GitHub-native</a> in the near future. ðŸ¤ž</p>
<p>As for immediate next steps, I want to add functionality to <code>gh-stack</code> so it creates the initial set of PRs on Github for you. Right now you have to create them manually and make sure each PR has the right <em>merges into</em> value set, which can be somewhat error prone.</p>
