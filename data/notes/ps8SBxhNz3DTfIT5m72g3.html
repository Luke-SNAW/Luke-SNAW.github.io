<p>Most of these problems shared a few things in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things didn’t break completely, they just degraded. That’s probably the right call, but it meant that I didn’t immediately notice there was a problem.</li>
<li>Compounding this, I had no idea how well the device “should” work, so I took a long time to notice that it was in a degraded state.</li>
<li>Even once I was aware of the problem, it was hard or impossible to understand the root cause and fix it because I didn’t know the right diagnostics (or they didn’t exist).</li>
</ul>
