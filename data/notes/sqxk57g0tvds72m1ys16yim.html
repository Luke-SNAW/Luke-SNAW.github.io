<ul>
<li>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and the same-origin policy are often conflated, as they work together to manage cross-origin resource access.</li>
<li>CORS was developed as a workaround for security vulnerabilities but is fundamentally flawed, as it does not adequately prevent cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks.</li>
<li>Implicit credentials in web browsers can lead to security risks, allowing malicious sites to make unauthorized requests using a user's credentials (e.g., cookies).</li>
<li>The default CORS policy allows requests but prevents reading results, which does not fully protect against certain types of attacks, such as unauthorized fund transfers.</li>
<li>The recommended approach to secure applications is to ignore implicit credentials for cross-origin requests and only allow explicit credentials through controlled exceptions.</li>
<li>Utilizing explicit credentials, such as API tokens or OAuth tokens in the Authorization header, can effectively mitigate XSRF risks and support multi-account functionality.</li>
<li>Setting the SameSite attribute on cookies to 'Lax' or 'Strict' can help prevent cookies from being sent with cross-origin requests, enhancing security.</li>
<li>A simple CORS policy allowing anonymous requests can protect against unauthorized access while still permitting necessary functionality.</li>
<li>Developers should be cautious about creating overly specific CORS policies, as they may inadvertently introduce new vulnerabilities or hinder legitimate use cases.</li>
<li>The web's security model is hindered by legacy decisions, but there are ongoing efforts by browser developers to enhance user privacy and security, albeit in an uncoordinated manner.</li>
