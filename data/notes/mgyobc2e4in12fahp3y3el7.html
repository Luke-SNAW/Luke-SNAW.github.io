<p>This demo is heavily inspired by Adam Argyle’s incredible <a href="https://codepen.io/argyleink/pen/LYEegOO">“4 layouts for the price of 1”</a> codepen. <em>It uses no media/container queries.</em> Instead of setting arbitrary breakpoints, it uses <em>fluid principles</em> to create a layout that flows seamlessly.</p>

<p>...</p>
<p><strong>Each layout algorithm is designed to solve a specific problem.</strong> The default “Flow” layout is meant to create digital documents; it's essentially the <em>Microsoft Word</em> layout algorithm. Headings and paragraphs stack vertically as blocks, while things like text, links, and images sit inconspicuously within these blocks.</p>
<p><strong>So, what problem does Flexbox solve?</strong> Flexbox is all about arranging a group of items in a row or column, and giving us a <em>ridiculous</em> amount of control over the distribution and alignment of those items. As the name suggests, Flexbox is all about <em>flexibility</em>. We can control whether items grow or shrink, how the extra space is distributed, and more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Is it still relevant?</strong></p>
<p>You might be wondering: now that CSS Grid is well-supported in modern browsers, isn't Flexbox obsolete?</p>
<p>CSS Grid is a wonderful layout mode, <strong>but it solves different problems than Flexbox.</strong> We should learn <em>both</em> layout modes, and use the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>Flexbox still reigns supreme when it comes to dynamic, fluid UIs that arrange items in a vertical or horizontal list. We'll see an example in this guide, the <em>deconstructed pancake</em>, that can't easily be accomplished with CSS Grid.</p>
<p>Honestly, as someone comfortable with both CSS Grid and Flexbox, I still find myself reaching for Flexbox quite often!</p>

<h2 id="alignment"><a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#alignment">Alignment</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#alignment"></a></h2>
<p>...</p>
<h3 id="content-vs-items"><a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#content-vs-items">Content vs. items</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#content-vs-items"></a></h3>
<p>So, based on what we've learned so far, Flexbox might seem pretty arbitrary. Why is it <code>justify-content</code> and <code>align-items</code>, and not <code>justify-_items_</code>, or <code>align-_content_</code>?</p>
<p>For that matter, why is there an <code>align-self</code>, but not a <code>_justify_-self</code>??</p>
<p><strong>These questions get at one of the most important and misunderstood things about Flexbox.</strong> To help me explain, I'd like to use a metaphor.</p>
<p>In Flexbox, items are distributed along the primary axis. By default, they're nicely lined up, side-by-side. I can draw a straight horizontal line that skewers <em>all</em> of the children, like a kebab?:</p>
<p>The cross axis is different, though. A straight vertical line will only ever intersect <em>one</em> of the children.</p>
<p>It's less like a kebab, and more like a group of cocktail wieners?:</p>
<p>There's a significant difference here. With the cocktail wieners, each item can move along its stick <em>without interfering</em> with any of the other items:</p>
<p>By contrast, with our primary axis skewering each sibling, a single item <em>can’t</em> move along its stick without bumping into its siblings! <strong>Try dragging the middle piece side to side:</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is the fundamental difference between the primary/cross axis.</strong> When we're talking about alignment in the <em>cross</em> axis, each item can do whatever it wants. In the <em>primary</em> axis, though, we can only think about how to distribute the <em>group</em>.</p>
<p><strong>That's why there's no</strong> <code>justify-self</code><strong>.</strong> What would it mean for that middle piece to set <code>justify-self: flex-start</code>? There's already another piece there!</p>
<p>With all of this context in mind, let's give a proper definition to all 4 terms we've been talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>justify</code> — to position something along the <em>primary axis</em>.</li>
<li><code>align</code> — to position something along the <em>cross axis</em>.</li>
<li><code>content</code> — a group of “stuff” that can be distributed.</li>
<li><code>items</code> — single items that can be positioned individually.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And so:</strong> we have <code>justify-content</code> to control the distribution of the group along the primary axis, and we have <code>align-items</code> to position each item individually along the cross axis. These are the two main properties we use to manage layout with Flexbox.</p>
<p>There's no <code>justify-items</code> for the same reason that there's no <code>justify-self</code>; when it comes to the primary axis, <em>we have to think of the items as a group,</em> as content that can be distributed.</p>
<p>What about <code>align-content</code>? Actually, this <em>does</em> exist within Flexbox! We'll cover it a little later on, when we talk about the <code>flex-wrap</code> property.</p>
<h2 id="hypothetical-size"><a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#hypothetical-size">Hypothetical size</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#hypothetical-size"></a></h2>
<p>Let's talk about one of the most eye-opening realizations I've had about Flexbox.</p>
<p>Suppose I have the following CSS:</p>
<pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css"><span class="token selector"><span class="token class">.item</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token property">width</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">2000</span><span class="token unit">px</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>A reasonable person might look at this and say: “alright, so we'll get an item that is 2000 pixels wide”. <em>But will that always be true?</em></p>
<p>Let's test it:</p>
<h3 id="code-playground">Code Playground<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#code-playground"></a></h3>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>style</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token style"><span class="token language-css">

</code></pre>
<p>This is interesting, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Both items have the exact same CSS applied.</strong> They each have <code>width: 2000px</code>. And yet, the first item is much wider than the second!</p>
<p>The difference is the <em>layout mode</em>. The first item is being rendered using Flow layout, and in Flow layout, <code>width</code> is a <em>hard constraint</em>. When we set <code>width: 2000px</code>, we'll get a 2000-pixel wide element, even if it has to burst through the side of the viewport like the Kool-Aid guy.</p>
<p>In <em>Flexbox</em>, however, the <code>width</code> property is implemented differently. It's more of a suggestion than a hard constraint.</p>
<p>The specification has a name for this: the <em>hypothetical size</em>. It's the size an element <em>would</em> be, in a perfect utopian world, with nothing getting in the way.</p>
<p>Alas, things are rarely so simple. In this case, the limiting factor is that the parent <em>doesn't have room</em> for a 2000px-wide child. And so, the child's size is reduced so that it fits.</p>
<p>This is a core part of the Flexbox philosophy. Things are fluid and flexible and can adjust to the constraints of the world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Inputs for the algorithms</strong></p>
<p>We tend to think of the CSS language as a collection of properties, but <strong>I think that's the wrong mental model.</strong> As we've seen, the <code>width</code> property behaves differently depending on the layout mode used!</p>
<p>Instead, I like to think of CSS as a collection of layout modes. Each layout mode is an algorithm that can <em>implement or redefine</em> each CSS property. We provide an algorithm with our CSS declarations (key/value pairs), and the algorithm decides how to use them.</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>the CSS we write is an input for these algorithms</strong>, like arguments passed to a function. If we want to <em>truly</em> feel comfortable with CSS, it's not enough to learn the properties; we have to learn how the algorithms <em>use</em> these properties.</p>
<p>This is the central philosophy taken by my course, <a href="https://css-for-js.dev/"><strong>CSS for JavaScript Developers</strong></a>. Rather than have you memorize a bunch of inscrutable CSS snippets, we pop the hood on the language and learn how all of the layout modes work.</p>

<h2 id="growing-and-shrinking"><a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#growing-and-shrinking">Growing and shrinking</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#growing-and-shrinking"></a></h2>
<p>So, we've seen that the Flexbox algorithm has some built-in flexibility, with <em>hypothetical sizes</em>. But to <em>really</em> see how fluid Flexbox can be, we need to talk about 3 properties: <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>, and <code>flex-basis</code>.</p>
<p>Let's look at each property.</p>
<h3 id="flex-basis"><a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#flex-basis">flex-basis</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#flex-basis"></a></h3>
<p>I admit it: for a long time, I didn't really understand what the <em>deal</em> was with <code>flex-basis</code>. 😅</p>
<p><strong>To put it simply:</strong> In a Flex row, <code>flex-basis</code> does the same thing as <code>width</code>. In a Flex column, <code>flex-basis</code> does the same thing as <code>height</code>.</p>
<p>As we've learned, everything in Flexbox is <em>pegged to the primary/cross axis</em>. For example, <code>justify-content</code> will distribute the children along the primary axis, and it works exactly the same way whether the primary axis runs horizontally or vertically.</p>
<p><code>width</code> and <code>height</code> don't follow this rule, though! <code>width</code> will always affect the horizontal size. It doesn't suddenly become <code>height</code> when we flip <code>flex-direction</code> from <code>row</code> to <code>column</code>.</p>
<p><strong>And so, the Flexbox authors created a generic “size” property called <code>flex-basis</code>.</strong> It's like <code>width</code> or <code>height</code>, but pegged to the <em>primary axis</em>, like everything else. It allows us to set the <em>hypothetical size</em> of an element in the primary-axis direction, regardless of whether that's horizontal or vertical.</p>
<p>Like we saw with <code>width</code>, <code>flex-basis</code> is more of a suggestion than a hard constraint. At a certain point, there just isn't enough space for all of the elements to sit at their assigned size, and so they have to compromise, in order to avoid an overflow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Not <em>exactly</em> the same</strong></p>
<p>In general, we can use <code>width</code> and <code>flex-basis</code> interchangeably in a Flex row, but there are some exceptions. For example, the <code>width</code> property affects replaced elements like images differently than <code>flex-basis</code>. Also, <code>width</code> can reduce an item below its <em>minimum</em> size, while <code>flex-basis</code> can't.</p>
<p>It's well outside the scope of this blog post, but I wanted to mention it, because you may occasionally run into edge-cases where the two properties have different effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="flex-grow">flex-grow<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#flex-grow"></a></h3>
<p>By default, elements in a Flex context will shrink down to their minimum comfortable size along the primary axis. This often creates extra space.</p>
<p>We can specify how that space should be consumed with the flex-grow property.</p>
<p>The default value for <code>flex-grow</code> is 0, which means that growing is opt-in. If we want a child to gobble up any extra space in the container, we need to explicitly tell it so.</p>
<p><strong>What if <em>multiple</em> children set <code>flex-grow</code>?</strong> In this case, the extra space is divvied up between children, proportionally based on their <code>flex-grow</code> value.</p>
<p>I think it'll be easier to explain visually. Try incrementing/decrementing each child. <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#flex-grow">https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#flex-grow</a></p>
<h3 id="flex-shrink">flex-shrink<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#flex-shrink"></a></h3>
<p>In most of the examples we've seen so far, we've had extra space to work with. But what if our children are <em>too big</em> for their container?</p>
<p><strong>Let's test it.</strong> Try shrinking the container to see what happens:
<a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#flex-shrink">https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#flex-shrink</a></p>
<p>Interesting, right? Both items shrink, <strong>but they shrink proportionally.</strong> The first child is always 2x the width of the second child.*</p>
<p>As a friendly reminder, <code>flex-basis</code> serves the same purpose as <code>width</code>. We'll use <code>flex-basis</code> because it's conventional, but we'd get the <strong>exact same result</strong> if we used <code>width</code>!</p>
<p><code>flex-basis</code> and <code>width</code> set the elements' <em>hypothetical size</em>. The Flexbox algorithm might shrink elements below this desired size, but by default, they'll always scale together, preserving the ratio between both elements.</p>
<p>Now, what if we <em>don't</em> want our elements to scale down proportionally? <strong>That's where the <code>flex-shrink</code> property comes in.</strong></p>
<p>Take a couple of minutes and poke at this demo. <strong>See if you can figure out what's going on here.</strong> We'll explore below.
<a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#flex-shrink">https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#flex-shrink</a></p>
<p><strong>The <code>flex-shrink</code> property lets us decide how that balance is paid.</strong></p>
<p>Like <code>flex-grow</code>, it's a ratio. By default, both children have <code>flex-shrink: 1</code>, and so each child pays ½ of the balance. They each forfeit 50px, their actual size shrinking from 250px to 200px.</p>
<p>Note that the absolute values don't matter, <strong>it's all about the ratio.</strong> If both children have <code>flex-shrink: 1</code>, each child will pay ½ of the total deficit. If both children are cranked up to <code>flex-shrink: 1000</code>, each child will pay 1000/2000 of the total deficit. Either way, it works out to the same thing.</p>
<h3 id="preventing-shrinking">Preventing shrinking<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#preventing-shrinking"></a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, we don't <em>want</em> some of our Flex children to shrink.</p>
<p>I notice this all the time with SVG icons and shapes. Let's look at a simplified example: <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#preventing-shrinking">https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#preventing-shrinking</a></p>
<p>When the container gets narrow, our two circles get squashed into gross ovals. <strong>What if we want them to stay circular?</strong></p>
<p>We can do this by setting <code>flex-shrink: 0</code>:
<a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#preventing-shrinking">https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#preventing-shrinking</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A simpler approach?</strong></p>
<p>So, I teach this concept in <a href="https://css-for-js.dev/">my course</a>, and every now and then, someone will wonder why we're going through all the trouble of using <code>flex-shrink</code> when there's a simpler approach available:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css"><span class="token selector"><span class="token class">.item</span><span class="token class">.ball</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token property">min-width</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">32</span><span class="token unit">px</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, I would have agreed. If we set a minimum width, the item won't be able to shrink below that point! We're adding a hard constraint, instead of the soft constraint of <code>width</code> / <code>flex-basis</code>.</p>
<p>I think this is one of those situations where it's easy to confuse “familiar” with “simple”. You're probably much more comfortable with <code>min-width</code> than <code>flex-shrink</code>, but that doesn't mean <code>flex-shrink</code> is more complicated!</p>
<p>After a few years of practice, I actually feel like setting <code>flex-shrink: 0</code> is the more straightforward / direct solution to this particular problem. Though, <code>min-width</code> still has an important role to play in the Flexbox algorithm! We'll talk about that next.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-minimum-size-gotcha">The minimum size gotcha<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-minimum-size-gotcha"></a></h2>
<p>There's <em>one more thing</em> we need to talk about here, and it's super important. It may be the single most helpful thing in this entire article!</p>
<p>Let's suppose we're building a fluid search form for an e-commerce store: <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#the-minimum-size-gotcha">https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#the-minimum-size-gotcha</a></p>
<p>When the container shrinks below a certain point, <strong>the content overflows!</strong></p>
<p><em>But why??</em> <code>flex-shrink</code> has a default value of <code>1</code>, and we haven't removed it, so the search input <em>should</em> be able to shrink as much as it needs to! Why is it refusing to shrink?</p>
<p><strong>Here's the deal:</strong> In addition to the <em>hypothetical</em> size, there's another important size that the Flexbox algorithm cares about: <em>the minimum size</em>.</p>
<p>The Flexbox algorithm refuses to shrink a child below its minimum size. The content will overflow rather than shrink further, <em>no matter how high we crank <code>flex-shrink</code>!</em></p>
<p>Text inputs have a default minimum size of 170px-200px (it varies between browsers). That's the limitation we're running into above.</p>
<p><strong>Here's the good news:</strong> We can redefine the minimum size with the <code>min-width</code> property.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Proceed with caution</strong></p>
<p>It's worth noting that the built-in minimum size <em>does</em> serve a purpose. It's meant to act as a guardrail, to prevent something even worse from happening.</p>
<p>For example: when we apply <code>min-width: 0px</code> to our text-containing Flex children, things break in an even worse way: <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#the-minimum-size-gotcha">https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#the-minimum-size-gotcha</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With great power comes great responsibility, and <code>min-width</code> is a particularly powerful property when it comes to Flexbox. It's gotten me out of a jam more than once, but I'm always careful to make sure I'm not making things worse!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="auto-margins">Auto margins<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#auto-margins"></a></h3>
<p>There's one other spacing-related trick I want to share. It's been around since the early days of Flexbox, but it's relatively obscure, and it <em>blew my mind</em> when I first discovered it.</p>
<p>The <code>margin</code> property is used to add space around a specific element. In some layout modes, like Flow and Positioned, it can even be used to center an element, with <code>margin: auto</code>.</p>
<p>Auto margins are much more interesting in Flexbox: <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#auto-margins">https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#auto-margins</a></p>
<p>Auto margins will <strong>gobble up the extra space, and apply it to the element's margin.</strong> It gives us precise control over where to distribute the extra space.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping">Wrapping<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#wrapping"></a></h2>
<p>So far, all of our items have sat side-by-side, in a single row/column. The <code>flex-wrap</code> property allows us to change that.</p>
<p>Each row is its own mini Flexbox environment. <code>align-items</code> will move each item up or down within the invisible box that wraps around each row.</p>
<p>But what if we want to <em>align the rows themselves</em>? We can do that with the <code>align-content</code> property: <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#wrapping">https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#wrapping</a></p>
<p>To summarize what's happening here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>flex-wrap: wrap</code> gives us two rows of stuff.</li>
<li>Within each row, <code>align-items</code> lets us slide each individual child up or down</li>
<li>Zooming out, however, we have these two rows within a single Flex context! The cross axis will now intersect <em>two</em> rows, not one. And so, we can't move the rows individually, we need to distribute them <em>as a group</em>.</li>
<li>Using our definitions from above, we're dealing with <em>content</em>, not <em>items</em>. But we're also still talking about the cross axis! And so the property we want is <code>align-content</code>.</li>
</ul>
