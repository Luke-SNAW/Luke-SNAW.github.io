<p>I’m not keen on writing specifications in gherkin (Given/When/Then) as I think it’s too generic and frequently makes the feature specifications too verbose – and takes emphasis away from the critical parts.</p>
<p>The important thing to note is <strong>the actual documentation artifact generated isn’t as important as the collaborative process that is involved in generating it.</strong> This is often about asking the right questions and adding more examples until there’s nothing that is unclear.</p>
<p>The document isn’t a template – the actual documentation varies based on conversation, problem and context.</p>

<ul>
<li>Royalties need to be paid in full on disbursement to artists.</li>
<li>A royalty payment can be made to an individual artist, or a group of artists.</li>
<li>When making payments to an individual artist they get 100% of royalties (no rounding)
When making payments to a group of artists this needs to be split by the percentage splits defined in the system which always add to 100%</li>
<li>When splitting a payment across a group of artists and it doesn’t split evenly into cents, the system currently randomly splits the cents between artists to balance out the rounding over time</li>
<li>This causes issues for both automated tests which need deterministic behaviour, and artists who are confused why they get slightly different amounts if their royalties are the same.</li>
</ul>

<li>Royalties need to be paid in full on disbursement to artists.</li>
<li>A single artist gets a whole payment.</li>
<li>When payments can be split evenly to a group of artists (to the cent) they are split that way.</li>
<li>When payments can’t be split evenly to a group of artists, the payments are split into an even split and the remaining cents are distributed to the members in whole cents.</li>
<li>The first member in the group – based on earliest date/time added to group – gets the higher amount, followed by the second, third etc. based on earliest date/time added.</li>
<li>Payments aren’t rounded to ten cents or five cent amounts, only whole cents</li>

<p>I think trying to force the above information into gherkin (Given/When/Then) statements would make it less readable and provides no added benefit – whilst Given/When/Then encourages consistency sometimes you just need structured thought that is most relevant to your context. The above document isn’t a template – it varies for the problems we’re trying to solve.</p>
