<p>I'm a senior frontend engineer doing a lot of code reviews and my team loves my MR (PR) submission standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Require the author to attach screenshots of the feature in a markdown table format showing the before and after comparison. This is enforced using a MR template.</li>
<li>Require the author to attach screen recording for complex user interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall effect is that it saves everyone's time.</p>
<ul>
<li>The author has to verify that the feature works anyway, so taking screenshots / recordings doesn't take much additional efforts.</li>
<li>The reviewer can focus on code itself instead of checking whether the code works.</li>
<li>Easy for both parties to spot design and UX issues/regressions visually.</li>
</ul>

<p>Code review != Testing.
A lot of people conflate these IMHO. Code review should not really be about whether it "works" or not. That's what tests are for.</p>
<p>Code reviews are about checking for code complexity, good use of abstractions, readability, etc.</p>
