## Collections

- [From Javascript to Rust](assets/pdfs/from-javascript-to-rust.pdf) from https://github.com/vinodotdev/node-to-rust/
- [Rust basics, from the perspective of a high level programmer](https://danbulant.eu/posts/rust-basics)
  - [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - an online book with short chapters about common things people want to do with Rust
  - [A gentle intro to Rust](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/) - A short “book” that can be read in an hour or two, with a day or two worth of examples if you try them locally. Much more in-depth than this post, but still easy to grasp.
  - [r/rust](https://reddit.com/r/rust) - The well-moderated reddit community (quick to search. If you have a problem that will take longer than a single Discord message, post it here so that others are able to find it as well).
  - [The discord community](https://discord.gg/rust) - A simple way to quickly ask other developers
  - [rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) - The sort of thing I’d be going about in here as well, but this is just a quick short intro, that should be your go-to book if you want to learn even more.

## Tools
