Unlike enterprise systems, the source of truth for an MMO's game world is the in-memory state, not the database, as persisting frequent updates would cause bottlenecks. To address this, the article recommends using a data service with the full state cached in memory. It should handle data access through RPCs while persisting only critical updates. This allows for direct, low-latency access while still enabling recovery from failures. Additionally, using techniques like compare-and-swap for writes can help avoid race conditions in the distributed system. Managing what data needs persistence and when is presented as more of an art than science to optimize for recovery needs over business requirements.

  - To reduce costs and increase speed, they developed a technique to generate a moderately sized corpus of completions made by a larger model, and fine-tune a smaller model to do the same task. This can reduce costs by 40x and increase speed by 5x. This is an interesting approach to using GPT-3 to reduce costs and increase speed, and could be useful for other applications.
