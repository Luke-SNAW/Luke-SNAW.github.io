  - To reduce costs and increase speed, they developed a technique to generate a moderately sized corpus of completions made by a larger model, and fine-tune a smaller model to do the same task. This can reduce costs by 40x and increase speed by 5x. This is an interesting approach to using GPT-3 to reduce costs and increase speed, and could be useful for other applications.
