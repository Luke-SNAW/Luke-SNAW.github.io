- Kant revolutionized Western philosophy by destroying the idea of absolute common sense and arguing that the focus should be on analyzing the subject (perspective of the observer) rather than the object.
- We each view the world through our own unique perspective based on our experiences and biases. There are no universal truths or correct answers.
- Interpersonal relationships are often based on superficial advice that doesn't lead to real understanding or communication between individuals.
- Wittgenstein argued that all communication and interaction is based on "language games" that involve specific contexts, emotions, and meanings beyond just words.
- To have genuine understanding, we must try to grasp the intentions and perspectives of others rather than make assumptions.
- Some people use justifications like "the world made me this way" to avoid responsibility, but **we should seek to understand their perspective without condoning harmful actions**.
- Developing empathy, self-awareness of biases, and listening skills can help improve interpersonal relationships and resolve conflicts.
- Individuals who think outside rigid frameworks have changed society by pursuing their own visions.
- Art like Picasso's paintings show there are no fixed or single correct ways of viewing something.
- Communication is a **skill that requires practice understanding others' emotions and intentions through "language games"**.
