## Criticism

- [issues](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33772556) - The "issues" on Github could be "bugs", "feature request" or even "improvement" (it could be anything actually).

## Security

- [Anyone can Access Deleted and Private Repository Data on GitHub](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github)
  - don't use private forks. Copy the repository instead. [#](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41060617)
  - the only way to securely remediate a leaked key on a public GitHub repository is through [key rotation](https://howtorotate.com/docs/introduction/getting-started/).
- [I scanned all of GitHub's "oops commits" for leaked secrets](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/guest-post-how-i-scanned-all-of-github-s-oops-commits-for-leaked-secrets)
  - Maybe I missed it but the article doesn't mention the even easier way to see this: the activity tab. Any force push to hide ugly prototype code is kept forever which annoys me. â€” [Pwhy1](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44452623)
