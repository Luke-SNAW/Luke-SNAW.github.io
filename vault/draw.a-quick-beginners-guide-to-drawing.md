**6 drawing exercises to get you started right now!**

The **basic craft of drawing** is about two things: you learn **to control your hand** and **to see**.

_Tip: For the following 6 exercises I suggest you **stick with one pen and one particular type of paper** (for instance A5)._

## Dexterity — two workouts

The first two exercises are about controlling your hand. We want to **build muscles** and train our **hand-eye-coordination**. Mechanical exercises like these are great for beginners. Later on you might use them to **explore new pens** or get started **when you don’t know what to draw** yet.

They are also terrific ways to relax your mind.

### Exercise 1: Circles — more is more!

**Distribute circles of various sizes on a piece of paper until the paper is filled. Make sure the circles do not overlap.**

![circle packing](http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_2.gif)

Drawing circles is not as easy as you might think. Notice how the circles become harder, the bigger you make them? Try them in both directions — and make lots of them.

_Tip: **Shake your hand** when it starts cramping! This is a workout for our hands after all._

### Exercise 2: Hatching — the joy of structure

**Fill a piece of paper with parallel lines.**

![hatching](http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_4.gif)

Diagonal lines come easiest for us because **they comply to the motion of our wrist**. Did you notice how left-handed people prefer the opposite direction than right-handed people? Have a look at drawings by your favourite draughtswoman or draughtsman (in my case: [Leonardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci)), and guess which hand they used!

**Now make sure to try other directions as well**. Have fun! Combine various hatchings and enjoy watching the darkness spread on your paper.

_Tip: **Don’t rotate the paper**. The whole point here is to train your hand to get comfortable with all directions._

**So now that we have worked our hands a little, let’s train our eyes!**

## Perception — learning to see

Drawing is mainly about [**seeing and understanding what you see**](http://ralphammer.com/seeing-vs-reading/). People often assume that everybody sees the same, but actually seeing is a skill which you can improve. **The more you draw, the more you see**. The next four exercises will **make you see more**.

### Exercise 3: Contour — Show me your hands!

**You see all those fascinating contours of your hand? Collect them on a piece of paper! Don’t try to draw the whole hand yet, just pick some of those lovely lines.**

![hand drawings](http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_6.gif)

Whether you draw a person, a plant, or your favourite animal, it is usually the **contours** that define a body or object and make others **recognise** them. The challenge is less to draw those distinctive lines but rather **to see them** in the first place!

**Even if you think you already know the shape of an object, it is always worth to take a closer look and rediscover it.**

### Exercise 4: Chiaroscuro — folding light and darkness

**Arrange and draw a piece of cloth. Start with the contours and then — using your hatching skills — create an interplay of light und darkness.**

![cloth drawings](http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_7.gif)

This exercise gives you a sense for light and darkness. I have to admit it is not the easiest and might as well be part of an advanced tutorial. Keep in mind: **This one is not about getting it perfectly “right”**. The cloth is a playground to try out those various hatchings you have practised before and feel how you can create light and shadows with your — almost — bare hands!

_Tip: You can use **curved hatching** to modulate the shapes, and **crosshatching** to achieve darker areas that resemble woven structures._

![curved hatching](http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_8.gif)

_Tip: Close your eyes just a little bit when you look at the cloth. You will see everything blurred, but you will also **see an enhanced contrast between light and dark**._

The arrangement of light is a great way to **show what is important** in a picture. Just have a look at paintings by [Rembrandt](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt_van_Rijn) or [Georges de la Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_de_La_Tour). And the next time you watch a movie look out for dramatic effects achieved with light and shadow.

### Exercise 5: Perspective — lost in space

**Let’s draw some cubes! Just follow the simple steps below.**

![perspective cubes](http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_10.gif)

Perspective drawing is basically a **projection of a 3D environment on a 2D surface** (your piece of paper).

![perspective explained](http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_11.gif)

Constructing perspective drawings is a bit of a science and cannot be covered in detail within the attention span of an online article. Nevertheless we can have some fun with **a simple technique** that gives us **an intuitive feel** for the magic of perspective drawing:

_**Step 1**_: Draw a horizontal line. This is the **horizon** of your picture.

![](http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_12.gif)

_**Step 2**_: Define two points on the horizon near the edge of the paper. These are your two vanishing points.

_**Step 3**_: Draw a vertical line somewhere.

_**Step 4**_: Connect the endpoints of the vertical line with the vanishing points.

_**Step 5**_: Add two vertical lines like this:

_**Step 6**_: Connect them with the vanishing points.

![](http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_17.gif)

_**Step 7**_: Now use a dark pencil or pen to emphasise the cube. Voilà!

![](http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_18.gif)

**Repeat steps 3–7 as often as you like**. Have fun! If you feel adventurous you might even hatch the sides of the cubes.

_Tip: When you draw lines that meet, it is usually a good idea to be confident and **let them overlap a little bit**. The shapes will look better defined._

![](http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_20.gif)

Mastering perspective drawings will give you the power to create illusions of depth. But most importantly, **you teach your brain how to think in three dimensions**. So even if you choose to draw “flat” drawings or mess with the “rules” of perspective — which I like to do — **to understand perspective drawing is still one of the most precious drawing skills you can learn**.

### Exercise 6: Composition — Why is this there?

**Make 5 different drawings of an object. Arrange the object differently on the paper each time!**

![composition exercise](http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_21.gif)

Composition is a great tool to **“say” something with a drawing**, to **shape its meaning or message**.

To understand how it works we have to bear in mind that our perception has been **shaped by everyday experiences**. For instance horizontal and vertical lines seem more “stable” to us than diagonals, which might “fall over” any second. And when we see a big dark shape at the bottom we somehow assume it must be “heavy”.

![](http://ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/beginnersguide_22.gif)

As you try different arrangements of your subject on a piece of paper, notice how this changes their connotations — their meaning.
