## [Distinguish that from which](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/short-sentences#distinguish_that_from_which)

**That** and **which** both introduce subordinate clauses. What's the difference between them? Well, in some countries, the two words are pretty much interchangeable. Inevitably though, alert readers from the United States will angrily announce that you confused the two words again.

In the United States, reserve **which** for nonessential subordinate clauses, and use **that** for an essential subordinate clause that the sentence can't live without. For example, the key message in the following sentence is that Python is an interpreted language; the sentence can survive without _Guido van Rossum invented_:

> Python is an interpreted language, **which** Guido van Rossum invented.

By contrast, the following sentence requires _don't involve linear algebra_:

> Fortran is perfect for mathematical calculations **that** don't involve linear algebra.

If you read a sentence aloud and hear a pause just before the subordinate clause, then use **which**. If you don't hear a pause, use **that**. Go back and read the preceding two example sentences. Do you hear the pause in the first sentence?

Place a comma before **which**; do not place a comma before **that**.
