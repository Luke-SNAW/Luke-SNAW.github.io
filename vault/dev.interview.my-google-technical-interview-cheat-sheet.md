## [https://www.pramp.com/#/](https://www.pramp.com/#/)

An interview practice tool. Take turns interviewing and being interviewed by someone with a shared code editor, and video and voice chat.  
The best resource. Interviews may be awkward or difficult at first, but the more you do, the more comfortable you will be, and the better you will do in a real interview.

Good questions from real interviews at Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc. I recommend codesignal over alternative code practice websites, because most questions include a target space and time complexity.

My favorite parts: Interview Preparation Grid (pg. 32), the whole behavioral questions section, and Interview Questions: Data Structures (pg. 88 - 107). If you haven't encountered space and time complexity before, this book has a good, quick, practical introduction to the concept.
