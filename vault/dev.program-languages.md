- [Why choose async/await over threads in Rust?](https://notgull.net/why-not-threads/) explains how async/await allows for more composable and flexible concurrency compared to threads, which can be difficult to synchronize. The author argues that the benefits of async/await, such as its ability to easily add timeouts and other functionality, are not always well-communicated.

Python has such a messy library story. I'm not a python developer, and coming into this ecosystem and trying to make things work with pip, conda, docker, etc. It's a mess.

I like Gradio, and built a few small apps, but it is still messy compared to Bumblebee.

Livebook + Bumblebee is magical. I'm productive in an instant, and the opportunity to build with Elixir and Phoenix makes this so exciting.
