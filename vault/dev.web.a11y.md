Chromium browsers (like Chrome and Edge) automatically support keyboard navigation anyways, but Firefox and Safari honor the system preferences.

  - Usually when we think of alt text, we think "What is this a picture of?" - but in the case of links where the only content is an image, the alt text needs to describe the function of that link. Not the image itself.

## [prefers-reduced-motion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31765773)

The `prefers-reduced-motion` feature is explicitly[^1] intended to accommodate people with vestibular motion disorders, which are common above age 40.[^2]

## [Unchain My Inaccessibly-Labelled Heart](https://css-tricks.com/unchain-my-inaccessibly-labelled-heart/)

```html
<h2 id="article1-heading">All About Dragons</h2>
<p>I like dragons. Blah blah blah blah blah.</p>
<p>
  <a
    id="article1-read-more"
    aria-labelledby="article1-read-more article1-heading"
  >
    Read more
  </a>
</p>
```

What happens there is a screenreader will replace the existing semantic label between the link tags and use the content from both elements and announce them together as a single string of text:

```html
Read more All About Dragons
```
