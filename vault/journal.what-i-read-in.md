  > - I just want to point out that for the second problem (scalability of CPU/memory/io), microservices almost always make things worse.
  > - I was working at Amazon when they started transitioning from monolith to microservices, and the big win there was locality of data and caching.
  > - Microservices are less _efficient_, but are still more _scalable_.
  > - I am working on a project that uses a microservice architecture to make the individual components scalable and separate the concerns. However one of the unexpected consequences is that we are now doing a lot of network calls between these microservices, and this has actually become the main speed bottleneck for our program, especially since some of these services are not even in the same data center. We are now attempting to solve this with caches and doing batch requests, but all of this created additional overhead that could have all been avoided by not using microservices.

  - [headbee](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33721068): I can attest to this and took all of my notes on paper in college. However, once I started a real job I realized that this strategy doesn't scale to all situations. In college, I needed to be able to recall all of the information I had ingested: it was low-write, high-read. In the workplace, there's much more information, but I'm unlikely to need most of it: it's high-write, low-read. I need to be able to reference the information, but not necessarily recall it. Taking paper notes became too much of a burden and I moved to a wiki of markdown notes.

  - **Browser Events** These events occur in the browser [window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) rather than the HTML page. Event handlers are bound to the window object, not to the element. E.g., load, error, scroll, resize, etc.
  - **HTML Events** This is the inverse of the browser event. They are the event that occurs in the [element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element), and the event handlers are bound to the element. E.g., click, mouseover, mouseenter, etc.
