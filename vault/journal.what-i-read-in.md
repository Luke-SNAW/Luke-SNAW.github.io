  - [headbee](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33721068): I can attest to this and took all of my notes on paper in college. However, once I started a real job I realized that this strategy doesn't scale to all situations. In college, I needed to be able to recall all of the information I had ingested: it was low-write, high-read. In the workplace, there's much more information, but I'm unlikely to need most of it: it's high-write, low-read. I need to be able to reference the information, but not necessarily recall it. Taking paper notes became too much of a burden and I moved to a wiki of markdown notes.

  - **Browser Events** These events occur in the browser [window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) rather than the HTML page. Event handlers are bound to the window object, not to the element. E.g., load, error, scroll, resize, etc.
  - **HTML Events** This is the inverse of the browser event. They are the event that occurs in the [element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element), and the event handlers are bound to the element. E.g., click, mouseover, mouseenter, etc.

  > A [statically-typed](https://buildtogether.tech/glossary/#static_typing) language like Java requires programmers to specify the data type of each variable; a [dynamically-typed](https://buildtogether.tech/glossary/#dynamic_typing) one like Python doesn't require them, though you can add them if you want, while TypeScript adds types as a layer on top of JavaScript. endrikat2014[^endrikat2014] found that declaring types does add complexity to programs, but it pays off fairly quickly by acting as documentation and by making [auto-completion](https://buildtogether.tech/glossary/#auto_completion) more accurate.
