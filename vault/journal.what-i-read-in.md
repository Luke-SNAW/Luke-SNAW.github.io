  > Travel became simpler → more vacations now involve flying a plane and thus obtaining tickets online and thus comparison-shopping, aggregating reviews of faraway places, etc → omg, vacation travel is complex again. It just allows to fulfill more of a dream. — [nine_k](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41914693)
  >
  > Tog's paradox is the main reason why I suspect that generative AI will never destroy art, it will enhance it. It allows you to create artworks within minutes that until recently required hours to create and years to master. This will cause new art to emerge that pushes these new tools to the limit, again with years of study and mastery, and they will look like nothing we've been able to produce so far. — [posix86](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41914285)

  - While hybrid work may have a neutral impact on individual productivity, its macroeconomic effects are positive due to broader labor market inclusion and lower transportation emissions.
    - Positive benefits include reduced commuting time and a quieter, less interrupted working environment
    - Reduced time in the office may reduce ability to learn, innovate, and communicate
    - No net productivity impact as positive and negative effects offset each other
      > The impact of fully remote working, which has been adopted by about 10 percent of employees, is highly dependent on how well it’s managed.

  - "Why not" comments can serve as signposts for future optimization or changes, even if the current code is working fine.
  - Lengthy function/variable names cannot fully replace "why not" comments, as they cannot capture the tradeoffs and reasoning behind the code.
  - The author suggests that "why not" comments may be a form of "counterfactuals" in human communication, which are difficult to self-document in code.

However, for most applications that process less than 10,000 requests per second, the complexity of JWTs is unnecessary. A simpler approach is to use a normal opaque session token stored in a database, which is the approach used by most web frameworks.

Since the handlers are pushed to the Microtask Queue, you can handle the eventual result in a non-blocking way. This makes it easier to handle errors, chain multiple operations together, and keep your code more readable and maintainable!

- [Postgres is eating the database world](https://medium.com/@fengruohang/postgres-is-eating-the-database-world-157c204dcfc4)
  > PostgreSQL is emerging as a dominant database platform that is capable of handling a wide range of use cases, from OLTP to OLAP workloads. Its extensibility through a thriving ecosystem of add-ons and integrations allows it to compete with specialized databases across various domains like time-series, geospatial, and vector data. The rise of analytical extensions like ParadeDB and DuckDB have further bolstered PostgreSQL's capabilities, making it a viable alternative to dedicated data warehousing solutions. As hardware advancements have addressed performance and scalability concerns, the need for separate OLTP and OLAP systems is diminishing, leading to a convergence where PostgreSQL can serve as a unified, multi-model database. The author argues that the real competitive frontier now lies in leveraging PostgreSQL's extensibility through integrated distributions and services, rather than focusing on the core database kernel.

- [LiveView is best with Svelte](https://blog.sequin.io/liveview-is-best-with-svelte/)
  > LiveView is a unique approach to building web applications that combines the benefits of server-rendered and client-side frameworks. While LiveView offers many advantages, the authors found some limitations around handling complex client-side interactions and the blurry line between client and server state. To address these challenges, the authors describe using LiveView together with the Svelte frontend framework, which they found to be a powerful and productive combination. The LiveView backend handles data fetching, validation, and state management, while the Svelte frontend focuses on rendering and simple event handling. This "LiveSvelte" approach eliminates the need for a separate frontend microservice and allows for a clean separation of concerns between the client and server.

  - Shift your focus toward keeping work moving and away from keeping people busy.
  - Work creates ROI only when a customer can use it. That means that completing work is more important than being busy.
  - It's more important for a team to be able to keep work moving than it is to keep the team small. Get work moving first, then think about how to reduce team size without compromising flow.

  > - You want to exclude some records (permanent retain) under explicit requirements, even if they match the criteria of an eligible record to be deleted.
  > - You don't want to delete the actual resource before returning the resource back. Basically, deletion before returning the value is not desired.

## Week 01, 2024

- [LLMs and Programming in the first days of 2024](http://antirez.com/news/140)
  > The author discusses their extensive use of large language models for programming tasks over the past year. They find LLMs most helpful for writing disposable code, learning new frameworks quickly, and accelerating documentation searches. While useful, LLMs still struggle with system programming problems requiring complex reasoning. The author believes LLMs have begun to show rudimentary reasoning abilities through their interpolation of concepts, but their capabilities are still limited. Overall, they argue LLMs are a valuable tool for programmers that can help focus time on more important problems and skills.
