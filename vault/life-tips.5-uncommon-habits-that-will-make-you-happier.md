Happiness is hard because it’s often at odds with what feels good in the moment. And left to our instincts, we tend to choose what feels good now over what will make us genuinely happy in the long-run.

Everybody wants to be happier.

The trouble is, it’s surprisingly hard to choose to do things that really make us happy…

- Will eating or abstaining from that second bowl of ice-cream make you happy?
- Will watching Netflix or going to the gym make you happy?
- Will buying that new iPhone or saving the money for a down payment on a new house make you happy?

**Happiness is hard because it’s often at odds with what feels good in the moment. And left to our instincts, we tend to choose what feels good now over what will make us genuinely happy in the long-run.**

Of course, every once in a while we break out of this default behavior and will our way to happiness-producing choices. But as anyone who’s ever tried a new diet knows, willpower alone is not a sustainable strategy for success.

> If you want to be consistently happier, you need to make consistently better choices. And the key to consistently better choices is habits.

What follows are 5 slightly unusual habits you can implement that will lead to a more consistent level of happiness in your life.

# 1. Try a morning music meditation

As a psychologist, whenever I see someone failing to follow through on a really good goal — one that will really benefit them and that they clearly want — the first thing I look for is _reward._

> The key to better morning habits is to make them enjoyable.

You don’t have to confine yourself to traditional breathing meditations — anything that helps you focus your attention and observe without thinking will work.

One of my favorite ways to meditate is with music because who doesn’t love listening to some of their favorite music, right?

# 2. Make time to be sad on purpose

If every time a painful emotion pops up you either try to get rid of it or distract yourself from it, you’re training your brain to be afraid of that emotion. Which means your brain’s going to be even more on the lookout for painful emotions in the future. And when they do appear, you’re going to respond with an even stronger fear response and impulse to avoid it.

When we fight or run away from our emotions we train our brains to be afraid of them.

Of course, this isn’t surprising. It’s natural to want to get rid of or avoid things that hurt and feel bad, including “negative” emotions like guilt, sadness, fear, etc.

But there’s a crucial mistake in this line of thinking:

**Just because an emotion feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad.**

> Emotional pain, just like physical pain, is a feature of the mind, not a glitch.

But when you constantly try to avoid or “fix” painful feelings, you’re essentially creating a phobia of your own emotions. And because you’re emotions are always going to be there, you’re setting yourself up for chronic suffering.

The way out of this vicious cycle is to do the opposite of your instinct:

**Instead of running away from painful emotions, try approaching them instead.**

Emotional pain is inevitable. Bad things happen and we feel bad as a result. But you don’t have to suffer the extended pain of feeling bad about feeling bad. You don’t need to be afraid and ashamed of painful feelings and moods.

Here’s little habit to get you started that I call [Scheduled Sadness](https://nickwignall.com/scheduled-sadness/):

- Pick a time of day that’s relatively quiet. Early evening often works well.
- Set a timer for 10 minutes on your phone.
- Sit down with a blank piece of paper and start writing about anything and everything you can think of that makes you feel sad. It could be personal (like grief over your recently deceased relative) or universal (sadness over the plight of refugees in a foreign country). It can also be extremely small (feeling a little hurt that your spouse didn’t notice that nice thing you did for him/her after dinner).
- The goal is to simply list the things that make you sad. Don’t elaborate too much on them or analyze them. Just get them out. Sort of like brainstorming. Don’t worry about spelling or punctuation or anything like that.
- Once your 10 minutes is up, throw the paper away.
- Repeat each day or at least a few times per week.

_Note: You can do this exercise with any difficult emotion. For example, with my clients who are very anxious, I often have them do “Scheduled Worry” where they write down all the things they’re anxious about._

# 3. Schedule calls with long-distance friends

# 4. Learn to draw

I think one of the most underrated tools for dramatically improving your mental health and emotional wellbeing is a hobby. The problem is, most people hear the word hobby and they think of an old man collecting stamps or an old lady crocheting with yarn.

- Playing basketball could be a hobby.
- Volunteering at a soup kitchen could be a hobby.
- Writing songs for the Ukeleili could be a hobby.
- Baking sourdough bread could be a hobby.
- Angel investing could be a hobby.
- Blogging could be a hobby.
- Birding could be a hobby.
- Administering a George R.R. Martin fan club forum could be a hobby.
- Making jewelry could be a hobby.
- Painting with watercolor could be a hobby.
- Tinkering with old cars could be a hobby.
- Teaching CrossFit could be a hobby.
- Making instructional yoga tutorials on YouTube could be a hobby.
- Podcasting about Pokemon could be a hobby.
- Triathaloning could be a hobby.
- Writing Harry Potter fan fiction could be a hobby.
- Writing online reviews of local restaurants could be a hobby.
- Amateur geology could be a hobby.
- Reproducing vintage travel posters from the 1920s could be a hobby.

# 5. Get up early on the weekends

I’d like to suggest, however, that sleeping in on the weekends is not a great idea, mostly for two reasons:

## 1. It’s not actually great for your sleep.

Sleeping in on the weekends is the biggest cause of [Social Jet Lag](https://nickwignall.com/bad-sleep-habits/), which itself is the biggest cause of the Monday Blues and a significant factor in why many people develop [full-blown insomnia](https://nickwignall.com/the-beginners-guide-to-insomnia/).

When you wake up late on Saturday and Sunday, you teach your brain to expect a late wake-up time on Monday and Tuesday as well. Then, when you don’t get it, you feel like garbage — in fact, it’s the exact same process that happens when you cross time zones. You’re confusing your biological clock with the one on the wall.

## 2. Sleeping in on the weekends has tremendous opportunity cost.
