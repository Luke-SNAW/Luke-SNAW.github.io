## [Monitor Events and Function Calls via Console](https://davidwalsh.name/monitorevents)

### Monitor Events

Pass an element and a series of events to `monitorEvents` to get a console log when the event happens:

```js
// Monitor any clicks within the window
monitorEvents(window, "click")

// Monitor for keyup and keydown events on the body
monitorEvents(document.body, ["keyup", "keydown"])
```

You can pass an array of events to listen for multiple events. The logged `event` represents the same event you'd see if you manually called `addEventListener`.

### Monitor Function Calls

The `monitor` method allows you to listen for calls on a specific function:

```js
// Define a sample function
function myFn() {}
// Monitor it
monitor(myFn)

// Usage 1: Basic call
myFn()
// function myFn called

// Usage 2: Arguments
myFn(1)
// function myFn called with arguments: 1
```

I really like that you can view the arguments provided, which is great for inspecting.

I usually opt for [logpoints](https://davidwalsh.name/logpoints) instead of embedding `console` statements in code, but `monitor` and `monitorEvents` provide an alternative to both.
