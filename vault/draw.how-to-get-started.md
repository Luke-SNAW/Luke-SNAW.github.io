How do I even begin my drawing? The secret to **jumpstart our creativity** is **fun**.

But how does that work?

# **We need to play**

Whenever I pass a public basketball court I am always struck by how the people who are literally stuck inside a cage are having more fun than those outside. The reason of course is obvious: They are having fun. They are **immersed in a game**.

What makes a good game? A **goal** and **rules**.

[Game = Goal + Rules](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rulesgoal2.gif?resize=360%2C84&ssl=1)

A good match is a **structured dance**, where players aim to **score** while they are following well-defined **rules**. This **freedom within a structure** is what makes it fun.

# **Drawing exercises are games**

Similarly, [drawing exercises](https://ralphammer.com/a-quick-beginners-guide-to-drawing/) aren’t just random doodles. They are structured, artistic games.

What a strange paradox: **Creative limitations set our creativity free!**

Here is an example for a drawing game:

# **Drawing Exercise: Oneliners**

**Draw an object in only one line!**

[Oneliners](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OneLiners-2.gif?resize=360%2C270&ssl=1)

**_Goal_**_: Draw_ **_five objects_** _in your household._

**_Rules_**_: Complete each drawing in_ **_one continuous line_** _without lifting your pen from the paper._

This is a great creative game: First of all it helps us **focus** because it limits our decisions. We don’t have to spend much time wondering what to draw. The guy on the internet said just pick 5 things. And during the drawing process itself our choices are always constrained by the current position of our pen.

[focus](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/focus2.gif?resize=220%2C100&ssl=1)

In theory we could spend hours on one single line. But at some point in the near future we will have to stop. And this will be the moment when we know that we are **done**. This **time limit** saves us from our perfectionist impulse to obsess over details. Instead of sticking with one drawing we can create many **variations**.

[time limit](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/timeline2.gif?resize=220%2C100&ssl=1)

That is also the moment when we can assess whether we have **reached our goal** or not. And maybe try again. We don’t get lost because we know what we want: one object in one line. We have a **fixed format**. Why 5? So that we know when it’s over! I could have written “3” or “7”. It doesn’t really matter. The point is to **define an end**.

[format](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/format2.gif?resize=220%2C100&ssl=1)

Yet, an even higher end is to **get better**. Since we **only** focus on contours and edges we inevitably **get better** at drawing them. The **skills** we want to learn keep us on the track towards the ultimate goal of mastering the craft.

[skill](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/skill3.gif?resize=220%2C100&ssl=1)

And those skills are also **fun to watch**. We love to [follow our heroes as they overcome obstacles](https://ralphammer.com/is-perfection-boring/) and make the impossible possible.

Even the rules themselves are beautiful. Immanuel Kant suggested that when we **sense order** in a piece of art, our **mind** starts to **dance with our senses**.

And this is not just true for drawings. There are plenty of great traditions, which at their core have simple rules:

**_Origami:_** Fold a piece of paper (15 x 15 cm) without cutting or gluing it.

**_Japanese wood joints:_** Connect pieces of wood without the use of nails, screws or glue.

These rule-bound structures are a feast for our senses.

# **How to build a creative playground**

Here are **4 tips** on how to lock yourself into a cage and have **fun**:

[variations, time limit, boundaries, skill](https://i0.wp.com/ralphammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/variationstimelimitboundariesskill-1.gif?resize=600%2C144&ssl=1)

**1. Make variations**: Stick with something that you can iterate and vary. Think of basketball: There is only **one** goal, yet there are **countless** ways to achieve it.

**2. Limit your time**: This lets you know when you are **done**.

**3. Pick a format**: You won’t get lost in **too many options**, as for instance: [too many pens](https://ralphammer.com/the-perfect-drawing-tool/).

**4. Focus on a skill**: Nothing protects us better from doubt than **personal progress**.

This is the magic formula for creative fun: **Less decisions — more room for play.**
