## Agile

The term [agile](https://buildtogether.tech/glossary/#agile) was coined in 2001 to describe a bottom-up approach to software project management based on very short iterations and frequent feedback from both developers and customers. \[[Masood2018](https://buildtogether.tech/bibliography/#Masood2018)\] and many others have found it to be effective for student projects; we will look at one form called [Scrum](https://buildtogether.tech/glossary/#scrum).

> ### Right place, right time
>
> Agile development practices are almost as old as programming, but they came into their own with the rise of the web in the late 1990s. First, the web made it possible to release software weekly, daily, or even hourly, since updating a server is a lot faster, and a lot less expensive, than shipping CDs to thousands of people. Second, during the 1990s and early 2000s it seemed as if web programming tools were changing every single day. Multi-year development plans didn't make a lot of sense when everything they depended on would be obsolete by the time work started, much less by the time it finished.

> Third, the growth of the web was aided by, and fuelled, the growth of the open source movement. People couldn't help noticing that most open source projects didn't have long-range plans, but nevertheless produced high-quality software faster than many closed-source commercial projects.
