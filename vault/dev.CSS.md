  - Avoid **disappearing messages**: let users close them.
  - Avoid long, fine drag gestures and **precision**.
  - Avoid **floating labels** and use static field labels instead.
  - Don’t rely on **icons** alone: add descriptive labels.
  - Ask for **explicit confirmation** for destructive actions.
  - Add a **“Back” link** in addition to the browser’s “Back” button.
  - In forms, present one question or **one topic per screen**.
  - Use sufficient **contrast** (particularly shades of blue/purple and yellow/green can be hard to distinguish).
  - Make **error messages** helpful and forgiving.

### Layers

#### [Hello, CSS Cascade Layers](https://ishadeed.com/article/cascade-layers/)

To overcome the fights with the cascade and specificity issues, we need to be careful about where to write a specific CSS block. In small projects, this can be okay, but for large ones, it’s a time-consuming task. As a result, we started to see different methods to help us organize our CSS better and thus reducing the cascade issues. The first three that came to my mind are the [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) (Block, Element, Modifier), [Smacss](http://smacss.com/) by Jonathan Snook and [Inverted Triangle CSS](https://itcss.io/) by Harry Roberts.

In this article, we’ll explore how cascade layers work, and how they will help us write CSS with more confidence, along with use-cases and examples.

## History

### [!important](https://twitter.com/stevenpemberton/status/1505839184287870981)

> CSS co-designer here.  
> !important was added for one reason only: laws in the US that require certain text to be in a given font-size. !important stops the cascade from changing it.  
> Anything else is probably misuse, and a sign you may not understand the cascade properly.

## SVG

### [Where, When, And When NOT To Use SVG!](https://medium.com/codex/where-when-and-when-not-to-use-svg-150d5a5d7592)

- When Shouldn’t We Use SVG?
  - Presentational monochrome images such as flat icons. Webfonts can be cached, the two modern formats of WOFF and WOFF2 compress much smaller than gzipping minified SVG.
- Is It Presentational And/Or Decoration? Then Don’t Put It In The Markup!
- If Not In The Markup, Where?
  - Your stylesheet. As a background-image.

  > The manipulation value disables gestures like ‘double-tap to zoom’. Other gestures like ‘panning’ and ‘pinch to zoom’ are unaffected. An extra benefit is that the browser no longer needs to delay the click event waiting for a second tap.
  ```css
  .button,::file-selector-button {
    inline-size: fit-content;
    touch-action: manipulation;
    user-select: none;
  }
  *:focus-visible {
