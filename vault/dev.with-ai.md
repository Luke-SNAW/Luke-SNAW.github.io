- [AI is an Ideology, Not a Technology](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-ai-is-an-ideology-not-a-technology/) argues that artificial intelligence is better understood as an ideology rather than just a technology. It promotes a view of autonomous machine intelligence that could replace humans, but this is a mirage since AI relies heavily on human data and contributions. An alternative view is to focus on how people are central to developing AI systems through providing examples, problem-solving and understanding the technology.

  > Tog's paradox is the main reason why I suspect that generative AI will never destroy art, it will enhance it. It allows you to create artworks within minutes that until recently required hours to create and years to master. This will cause new art to emerge that pushes these new tools to the limit, again with years of study and mastery, and they will look like nothing we've been able to produce so far. — [posix86](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41914285)

    1. AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents,
    2. this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but
    3. in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and
    4. breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning.

  - Claims that AI increases speed or productivity often come from lowering quality standards while accepting additional risks, or stem from the interests of AI vendors.

This has been my complaint about AI from the beginning, and it hasn't gotten better. In the time spend I figuring out how to explain to the AI what I need it to do, I can just sit down and figure it out. AI, for me, has never been a useful assistant for writing code.
Where AI has really improved my productivity is in acting like a colleague I can talk to. "I'm going to start working on X: how would you approach it? what should I know that isn't obvious from the beginning?" or "I am thinking about using Y approach for X problem but I don't see a lot of literature about it. Is there a reason it's not more common?".

These "chats" only take 10-30 minutes and have already led me to learn a bunch of new things, and helps keep me moving on projects where in the past I'd have spent 2-3x as long working through ideas, searching for literature, and figuring things out.
