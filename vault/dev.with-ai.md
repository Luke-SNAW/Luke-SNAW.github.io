- [AI is an Ideology, Not a Technology](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-ai-is-an-ideology-not-a-technology/) argues that artificial intelligence is better understood as an ideology rather than just a technology. It promotes a view of autonomous machine intelligence that could replace humans, but this is a mirage since AI relies heavily on human data and contributions. An alternative view is to focus on how people are central to developing AI systems through providing examples, problem-solving and understanding the technology.

  > — Salons and groups have always existed but why the recent shift to private discourse?  
  > Because the public internet makes it too easy for people to sell you stuff, extract value from you, or harass you. Private chats are human-scale environments where understandable social norms---not commerce, algorithms, or formal rules---drive the interactions. It's an authentic experience.

  > Travel became simpler → more vacations now involve flying a plane and thus obtaining tickets online and thus comparison-shopping, aggregating reviews of faraway places, etc → omg, vacation travel is complex again. It just allows to fulfill more of a dream. — [nine_k](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41914693)

  > Tog's paradox is the main reason why I suspect that generative AI will never destroy art, it will enhance it. It allows you to create artworks within minutes that until recently required hours to create and years to master. This will cause new art to emerge that pushes these new tools to the limit, again with years of study and mastery, and they will look like nothing we've been able to produce so far. — [posix86](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41914285)
