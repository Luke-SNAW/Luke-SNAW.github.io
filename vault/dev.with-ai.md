- [AI is an Ideology, Not a Technology](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-ai-is-an-ideology-not-a-technology/) argues that artificial intelligence is better understood as an ideology rather than just a technology. It promotes a view of autonomous machine intelligence that could replace humans, but this is a mirage since AI relies heavily on human data and contributions. An alternative view is to focus on how people are central to developing AI systems through providing examples, problem-solving and understanding the technology.

  > Tog's paradox is the main reason why I suspect that generative AI will never destroy art, it will enhance it. It allows you to create artworks within minutes that until recently required hours to create and years to master. This will cause new art to emerge that pushes these new tools to the limit, again with years of study and mastery, and they will look like nothing we've been able to produce so far. — [posix86](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41914285)

    1. AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents,
    2. this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but
    3. in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and
    4. breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning.

This has been my complaint about AI from the beginning, and it hasn't gotten better. In the time spend I figuring out how to explain to the AI what I need it to do, I can just sit down and figure it out. AI, for me, has never been a useful assistant for writing code.
Where AI has really improved my productivity is in acting like a colleague I can talk to. "I'm going to start working on X: how would you approach it? what should I know that isn't obvious from the beginning?" or "I am thinking about using Y approach for X problem but I don't see a lot of literature about it. Is there a reason it's not more common?".

These "chats" only take 10-30 minutes and have already led me to learn a bunch of new things, and helps keep me moving on projects where in the past I'd have spent 2-3x as long working through ideas, searching for literature, and figuring things out.

> 하지만, 실제 프로젝트에 사용된 프롬프트들은 AI 코딩에 가장 잘 먹히는 방식과 일치함
> 명확하고 꼼꼼한 아이디어를 수백 개의 작은 문제로 쪼개고, 정말 중요한 부분에는 구체적인 아키텍처적 가이드를 주는 방식이 효과적임

> > 기술 리드와 프로덕트 오너 역할을 병행하는 입장에서, 이 방식이 인간과 일할 때도 정석임
> > 내 일의 70%는 임원의 “타임 트래블 타워 게임, 버그 없이”라는 추상적 요구를, 팀이 높은 추상화를 유지하면서 서로 겹치지 않게 작업할 수 있도록, 강력한 아키텍처 비전이 맥락에 담긴 일련의 프롬프트로 바꾸는 일임

> > AI 코딩에서 잘 통하는 내 방식은, 기본 기능이나 게임플레이 뼈대를 AI로 ‘원샷’으로 만든 뒤, 그 위에 여러 번 반복적으로 쌓아가는 것임
> > 원샷 결과가 바로 인상적이지 않으면, 바로 다른 프롬프트로 보완해서 괜찮은 결과가 나올 때까지 재시도해 기반을 마련함

> AI는 크게 세 가지 역할을 함
> (1) 학습 도구 - 내가 용어를 몰라도 질문 의도를 잘 파악해서 시작점을 잡아주고, ‘내가 몰랐던 사실’까지 알려주기에 제일 중요한 역할임
> (2) 반복적이거나 지루한 일 처리 - 코드 주석, 설정 파일 작성 등은 내가 할 수도 있지만 속도를 늦추는 일들을 무난하게 처리함
> (3) 검색 - (1)번처럼 실제로 내가 원하는 게 뭔지 AI가 파악해 필터링이나 추천 등을 맡김
> AI에게 “생각”을 맡길 수도 있지만 그럴 필요는 없음
> 인간보다 똑똑하지 않고 단지 더 빠르고 더 많은 걸 아는 FPU 같은 존재임

> 회의론의 이유는 현재 AI 솔루션이 “팔리고 있는 모습”과 “실제 하는 일” 사이의 간극 때문임
> 모든 AI 솔루션, 특히 에이전트는 숙련된 사람의 가이드 없이는 쓸모 없는 결과만 냄
> 실제로 “자율적”인 요소는 거의 없음
> ‘vibe coding’이라는 용어를 만든 사람조차, 업계가 순서를 거꾸로 밟고 있다고 얘기함

> 디버깅에서 큰 도약이 일어남
> 예전처럼 print만 찍지 않고, 코드를 복사해 붙여넣기만 해도 “출력이 이렇지 않고 저렇다는 데 왜 그렇냐?”고 AI에게 물어 빠르게 원인과 대안을 얻을 수 있음

Today physical world is largely mechanized, we rarely walk, run lift heavy things for survival. So we grow fat and weak unless we exercise. Tomorrow vast majority of us will never think, create, investigate for earning a living. So we will get dumb and dumber over time. A small minority of us will keep polishing their intellect but will never be smarter than machines just like the best athletes of today can't outrun machines.

AI를 coding에 사용하는 방법이 사람마다 다름

- 초기 8~90% critical path는 자신이 작성, 나머지 시간걸리는 세부사항은 AI에게
- 반대로 뼈대를 AI에게 맡기고 디테일+완성은 자신이
- 문서화, test 작성 등 덜 흥미로운 일들을 AI에게
