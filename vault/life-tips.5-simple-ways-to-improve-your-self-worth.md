# 1. Live life as if you had no willpower

One of the biggest sources of low-self worth is habitually breaking promises to ourselves:

- You tell yourself you’re going to work out today after work. But as soon as you get home, you hit the couch instead of the gym.
- You tell yourself you’re going to be a better listener the next time your spouse talks about stress at work. But you find yourself “checked out” in your very next conversation with them.
- You tell yourself just one portion of dinner tonight and end up with a heaping pile of seconds.

**If you chronically break your promises to yourself, is it any surprise that your self-worth is low?**

But why does this happen? Why is it so hard to follow through on even relatively simple commitments?

Well, there are lots of reasons. But here’s one that’s often under appreciated: Relying on willpower is a terrible strategy for following through on your commitments.

Willpower is like your car’s emergency brake: Nice to have in a pinch but not something you should rely on for day-to-day driving because really, it’s just not that powerful.

Concrete plans, however, are powerful. But they’re also time-consuming and effortful to create (not to mention kinda unsexy).

For example, if you want to actually follow-through and go to the gym today after work, which is more likely to help you do it:

1. _Hopefully willpower will kick in this evening…_
2. _I’ve set an alarm on my phone to go off a half an hour before work ends to remind me; I’ve got my gym bag packed and in the car; I’ve decided on what workout I’m going to do and for how long; I’ve told my spouse about it so that they’re not expecting me ‘till a bit later; and I called up a friend to meet me there so we can work out together._

Obviously, your odds are better with option 2.

If you want to improve your self-worth, you need to get better at following through on the promises you make yourself. And if you want to start keeping your promises to yourself, live life as if you had no willpower so that you’ll be forced to rely on something more effective like good planning.
