- Backtesting is important but past performance does not guarantee future results, as new technologies and market changes can impact strategies over time.
- Overly complex models tend to overfit the sample data and perform poorly out-of-sample on validation data. Simple and robust strategies are preferable.
- Strategies should be validated on data not used for model development to properly assess out-of-sample performance.
- Revealing validation results risks further overfitting models to the validation data. Strict separation of training and validation data is important.
- Even with abundant data, survival bias can influence strategies that rely too heavily on historical patterns no longer relevant.
- Most quant strategies underperformed in 2021, highlighting the risks of strategies dependent on past trends.
