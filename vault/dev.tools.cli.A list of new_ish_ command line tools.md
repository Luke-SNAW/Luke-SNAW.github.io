Hello! Today I asked [on twitter](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1513903221466664962) about newer command line tools, like `ripgrep` and `fd` and `fzf` and `exa` and `bat`.

I got a bunch of replies with tools I hadn’t heard of, so I thought I’d make a list here. A lot of people also pointed at the [modern-unix](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix) list.

## less-new tools

Here are a few of not-so-new tools folks mentioned aren’t that well known:

- pv (“pipe viewer”, gives you a progress bar for a pipe)
- vidir (from [moreutils](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils), lets you batch rename/delete files in vim)
- sponge, ts, parallel (also from moreutils)

## some of my favourites

My favourites of these that I use already are `entr`, `ripgrep`, `git-delta`, `httpie`, `plocate`, and `jq`.

I’m interested in trying out `direnv`, `btm`, `z`, `xsv`, and `duf`, but I think the most exciting tool I learned about is `vidir`.
