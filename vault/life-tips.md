## Focus

### [wodenokoto](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33258142)

In moment to moment work, I am starting to think focus is more about _not_ keeping busy when you need to wait for something.  
1 minute compile time? Not an opportunity to check your email or hacker news.

- Absolutely. Focusing on lots of different tasks is the antithesis of focus. Focus is identifying and executing against one singular goal.
- Tis true. Eat the boredom for a minute.
- Yeah, I have a rack of dumbbells next to my desk (WFH for the win). I'll get up and run through a 1-2 minute complex. Not enough to sweat, but great for a refocus.

In this vein, classical ethicists talk about the vice of curiosity as opposed to the virtue of studiousness. Studiousness is the virtue of attention, of self-mastery in relation to intellectual pursuits, of prudent allocation of attention to what you should; curiosity is the vice of inattention, of spreading yourself too thin, to pursue things other than what one should or what is not worth pursuing, pursuing that which is beyond your reach, of flitting about between things, of inordinate desire in the domain of intellectual pursuits. The studious man attains wisdom, the curious man remains, at best, a coasting, superficial dilettante. The difference between the studious man and the curious man is something like the difference between the committed and faithful husband and the waffling philanderer. The former shows restraint in relation to his appetites and is able to build a relationship and raise a family, while the latter is a mess who never achieves anything of value, slavishly indulging his appetites that lead nowhere but his own misery and mediocrity. In all these cases, desirable things may present themselves that would derail you from your aim and sabotage your achievement and your own good. In all these cases, commitment involves refusing to indulge those desires because doing so is counterproductive and harmful in relation to the good pursued.

In life, we must make decisions. The word "decision" comes from the Latin "to cut off", as in to cut off options or paths. The grapevine must be pruned to strengthen it and produce more fruit. Of course, we must decide wisely, there is no question about that, but FOMO is the opposite of that. It is an intemperate and immoderate desire for everything, never committing to anything and therefore never attaining anything and never becoming anything.

## [Bob Ross and imposter syndrome](https://gomakethings.com/bob-ross-and-imposter-syndrome/)

Bob was the ultimate anti-imposter syndrome advocate. His trademark line was…

> We don’t make mistakes. We make happy little accidents.

**It’s ok to feel like you’re not 100 percent sure what you’re doing. After 10 years of doing this, I still look stuff up every day.**

That doesn’t make you an imposter.

It makes you a beginner. It makes you a learner. It makes you someone who gets to experience that joy of looking at this amazing work we do with fresh eyes and new perspectives.

## [How To Finally Make Something](https://medium.com/@scott.stevenson/how-to-finally-make-something-a16c8db7ba2a)

Creativity ultimately means stepping forward without knowing where we’re going. Unfortunately, unstructured and ambiguous tasks make us anxious.

To avoid this anxiety we constantly substitute playing the real game of creation with other activities that feel more structured — what I’ll call “fantasy games”.

I’ll nickname four ways this ailment shows up as:

1. Learning Syndrome
2. Tool Syndrome
3. Process Syndrome
4. Maintenance Syndrome

## [3 Habits The Wealthiest People Practice Daily That Most Others Don't](https://medium.com/wealthwise/3-habits-the-wealthiest-people-practice-daily-that-most-others-dont-423b62e60f0a)

They Ask $30,000 Questions Instead of $3 Questions

Examples of $3 questions are:

- Should I make my coffee at home or get it at Starbucks?
- Should I buy organic tomatoes or non-organic?
- Should I cancel Netflix now that it’s a few dollars more expensive?
- I have $10,000 in savings, should I switch banks with a 0.10% higher interest rate? (only makes a $10 difference per year)

Examples of $30,000 questions are:

- Can I earn more by negotiating a raise or switching jobs?
- Should I start a side-hustle so I can make an extra $1000 per month?
- Do I invest consistently and automatically?
- How much am I paying in investment fees?
- What’s the interest rate on this 30-year mortgage?
- Can I increase my monthly savings rate to 15%?

## [Learn Exponentially](https://saveall.ai/blog/learn-exponentially)

> **Spaced repetition is a rapid exponential process**

To visualize what this means we can [estimate (as fairly we can)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1InSARQ8FGJzmcc-Cn86RmsihQ77EsHi1?usp=sharing) how much you learn from 60 minutes reading per day vs. 30 minutes reading + 30 minutes spaced repetition per day:

The difference is extraordinary even when looking only 5 years ahead. **Use spaced repetition over a lifetime and you’ll be hundreds of times more knowledgeable.**

So sure, learn spaced repetition, but really, find something and practice it for more joy and better results instead.
