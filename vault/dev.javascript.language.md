  ```text
  Lexical scope is the definition area of an expression.

  In other words, an item's lexical scope is the place in which the item got created.

  Note:
  - Another name for lexical scope is static scope.
  - The place an item got invoked (or called) is not necessarily the item's lexical scope. Instead, an item's definition space is its lexical scope.

  - Method Invocation: `this` equals the object that owns the method.

## [Avoid the ‚Äúdelete‚Äù Keyword in JavaScript](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/avoid-the-delete-keyword-in-javascript-87ff2a47f26c)

```javascript
const snowbit = {
  age: 15,
  test: "abc",
}
const { test, ...newSnowbit } = snowbit
console.log(newSnowbit) //  {age: 15}
```

Let me explain, You should not use `delete` to remove the property from the object because this mutates the original and that can lead to unpredictable behaviours and becomes difficult to debug.

## [What are wrapper objects for primitive values?](https://2ality.com/2022/02/wrapper-objects.html)

Each of the primitive types `boolean`, `number`, `bigint`, `string` and `symbol` has an associated _wrapper class_ (`Boolean`, `Number`, `BigInt`, `String`, `Symbol`). In this blog post, we examine what these classes are good for.

## Closure

- [Closures](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_closures.asp): A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
- [Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures): A function bundled together with its lexical environment forms a closure.

### [Advantages and Disadvantages of Closures](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/closures-in-javascript-js-interview-series-c93af277bfac)

#### Advantages

- Closures help in data encapsulation, i.e, with closures, you can store data in a separate scope and share it only where necessary.
- Modern JavaScript libraries (like React) heavily rely on closures for rendering components on state or prop change.

#### Disadvantages

- Closures consume a lot of memory space since the functions need to store the value of the variable in memory, even though the function of the variable itself would not be used multiple times in the code.

## Promise

- [JavaScript Promises: then(f,f) vs then(f).catch(f)](https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-promises-then-vs-then-catch/)

## Symbol

- [JavaScript Symbols: the Most Misunderstood Feature of the Language?](https://blog.bitsrc.io/javascript-symbols-the-most-misunderstood-feature-of-the-language-282b6e2a220e)

  ```javascript
  let a = "foo"
  ```

  - The primitive is ‚Äúfoo‚Äù, not `a`.
  - Another very interesting aspect around this, is that primitives in JavaScript are immutable. That means you can‚Äôt change the number 2 ever. Instead, you can reassign a variable to have another (immutable) primitive value.
  - Symbols are primitive values and can be assigned to variables.

  - **HTML Events** This is the inverse of the browser event. They are the event that occurs in the [element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element), and the event handlers are bound to the element. E.g., click, mouseover, mouseenter, etc.
