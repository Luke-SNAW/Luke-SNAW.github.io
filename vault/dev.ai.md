- [AI is an Ideology, Not a Technology](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-ai-is-an-ideology-not-a-technology/) argues that artificial intelligence is better understood as an ideology rather than just a technology. It promotes a view of autonomous machine intelligence that could replace humans, but this is a mirage since AI relies heavily on human data and contributions. An alternative view is to focus on how people are central to developing AI systems through providing examples, problem-solving and understanding the technology.

## [Why it's essential to excel at the things AI excels at](https://youtube.com/watch?v=mdoMPWSSsqs)

- Learning areas that AI excels in, like coding, English, design and data, will provide more opportunities as these are fields where AI is commonly utilized.
- Relying entirely on external support and outsourcing prevents one from developing self-awareness, confidence and resilience to overcome challenges.
- Gaining expertise in an AI-strong domain allows one to effectively lead AI-assisted innovations and make the most of AI capabilities.
- Information alone is insufficient - one must make connections between concepts internally through understanding.
- Insights emerge from linking disparate ideas, which only occurs through internal reflection not external instruction.
- Wisdom develops from accumulating insights over time through dedicated study.
- Specializing in an AI field builds an expertise level others rely on, while AI supports less skilled roles.
- Psychologically, self-learning builds identity, willpower and problem-solving skills.
- Opportunities arise from innovating where AI supports human strengths, not replacing them.
- Mastery requires climbing from foundations, so comprehensively studying AI domains leads to leadership.
