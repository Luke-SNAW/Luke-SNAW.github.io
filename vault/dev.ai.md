- [AI is an Ideology, Not a Technology](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-ai-is-an-ideology-not-a-technology/) argues that artificial intelligence is better understood as an ideology rather than just a technology.

An alternative view is to focus on how people are central to developing AI systems through providing examples, problem-solving and understanding the technology.
