### [Why we‚Äôre moving away from Firebase](https://koptional.com/article/why-we%E2%80%99re-moving-away-from-firebase)

We‚Äôve developed a few small projects on Supabase recently as a part of our prospecting process. The developer experience has been delightful, particular [Row Level Security](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security), the more powerful analog to Firestore Rules. That Supabase is betting on [Deno](https://deno.com/deploy) for their [serverless function suite](https://deno.com/blog/supabase-functions-on-deno-deploy) indicates to us that they are serious about great technology.

We love [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) which Supabase utilizes. We plan to do more research on scalability, since SQL databases can‚Äôt grow as big as their NoSQL counterparts. Nonetheless, Supabase came at the right time.

#### [Hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33215770)

It's from Google, they deprecate things every 6 months including APIs your app is using, if you don't follow your app will be down pretty quickly. AWS nearly never do breaking changes.

[Firebase founder]

I no longer work at Firebase / Google, but two points:

1. There may be issues with the GCP integrations & UX/DX, but GCP integration is good for many customers and necessary for the future of the business.

   One of the common failure modes for the 2011-2014 crop of Backend-as-a-Service offerings was their inability to technically support large customers. The economics of developer tooling are a super-power-law. So, if you hope to pay your employees you'll need to grow with your biggest customers.

   Eventually, as they become TheNextBigThing, your biggest customers end up wanting the bells and whistles that only a Big Cloud Platform provide.

   This was a part of the reason we chose to join Google, and why the Firebase team really really really pushed hard to integrate with GCP at a project, billing, and product level (philosophy: Firebase exposed the product from the client, GCP from the server) despite all the organizational/political overhead.

2. I'm excited to see the current crop of app platforms emerge. It has been 10 years since [we launched](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3832877) and there are now some great innovations in the space. I like the way [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) has exposed Postgres and [InstantDB](https://www.instantdb.com/) graphdb+realtime is really promising.
