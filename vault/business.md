  - **Interconnected Problems**: Housing shortages exacerbate multiple societal challenges, including inequality, climate change, low productivity, obesity, and declining fertility rates.
  - **Economic Impact**: High housing costs limit disposable income, reducing spending in other sectors and hindering economic growth.
  - **Productivity Drain**: Expensive housing restricts labor mobility, forcing skilled workers to remain in less productive jobs, thereby lowering overall productivity.
  - **Innovation Stifling**: Limited housing supply in high-demand areas hampers innovation by restricting the collaboration opportunities that dense urban environments facilitate.
  - **Rising Inequality**: Housing scarcity turns homes into valuable assets, disproportionately benefiting landowners and increasing income inequality within communities.
  - **Regional Disparities**: Housing shortages contribute to regional inequality, as lower-income individuals cannot afford to relocate to high-opportunity cities, stalling economic convergence among regions.
  - **Family Dynamics**: High housing costs affect family planning, with expensive homes discouraging larger families and delaying childbirth.
  - **Health Consequences**: Urban sprawl and lack of walkable environments linked to housing shortages contribute to rising obesity rates and related health issues.
  - **Environmental Impact**: More densely populated, walkable cities lead to lower carbon emissions, whereas sprawl increases reliance on cars and energy consumption.
  - **Urgent Solutions Needed**: Addressing housing shortages is crucial for improving quality of life, fostering economic growth, and creating equitable communities, necessitating innovative policy approaches to increase housing supply.

This concern is valid for a huge company or anybody that wanna get like 70% of the whole market.

For solo/small teams? Think of yourself as a street cart vendor that sells hamburgers, and is located on the front of mac donalds.

They still sell.

What you has but not others is that you are small, and is the actual person other person can , FOR REAL, talk about your product.

That is the whole thing of working as a freelancer, solo, small business. You can, FOR REAL, provide personal training/consulting/support, etc.

And that works even if you just take the product made by the big corporation and just know how to use it. There is business in being the guy who knows Excel well.
