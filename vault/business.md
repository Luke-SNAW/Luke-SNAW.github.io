This concern is valid for a huge company or anybody that wanna get like 70% of the whole market.

For solo/small teams? Think of yourself as a street cart vendor that sells hamburgers, and is located on the front of mac donalds.

They still sell.

What you has but not others is that you are small, and is the actual person other person can , FOR REAL, talk about your product.

That is the whole thing of working as a freelancer, solo, small business. You can, FOR REAL, provide personal training/consulting/support, etc.

And that works even if you just take the product made by the big corporation and just know how to use it. There is business in being the guy who knows Excel well.
