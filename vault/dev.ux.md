- [Designing Better Breadcrumbs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/04/designing-better-breadcrumbs/)
  - Breadcrumbs always need to complement main navigation.
  - Breadcrumbs fit best **under global navigation**.
  - They could also appear above main headings.
  - The delimiter should be **pointing to the right** (in RTL interfaces).
  - Breadcrumbs should be **visible without scrolling**.
  - Avoid “disabled” breadcrumbs and turn all breadcrumbs into links.
  - The current page can be dropped if breadcrumbs live above headings.
  - Otherwise, include the current page in breadcrumbs for clarity.
  - On mobile, use accordions to display a full path if needed.
  - The parent of the current page should be visible at all times.
  - **Sideways breadcrumbs** might be a quite surprising and useful discovery for your users.
