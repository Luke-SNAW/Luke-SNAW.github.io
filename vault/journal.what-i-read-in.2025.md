## Week 51, 2025

- [Why Your Best Engineers Are Interviewing Elsewhere](https://codegood.co/writing/why-your-best-engineers-are-interviewing-elsewhere)
  - Hierarchies within organizations tend to filter out bad news, preventing executives from being aware of developing problems until they become crises.
  - Middle managers often suppress bad news to appear professional and 'handle problems at their level,' leading to information latency.
  - Skip-level conversations (executives talking directly to engineers several levels down) are often discouraged due to concerns about undermining middle management, but they provide crucial ground truth.
- [Software Component Names Should Be Whimsical And Cryptic](https://medium.com/better-programming/software-component-names-should-be-whimsical-and-cryptic-ca260b013de0)
  - Descriptive names for software components can be misleading as the scope and purpose of a component can change over time, rendering the original name inaccurate.
  - Descriptive names create an [illusion of transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_transparency) rather than true clarity, leading to incorrect assumptions about a component's functionality.
  - For variables within code that are frequently changed, descriptive names like numCols and numRows are preferable to generic ones like i and j.
  - When a name serves as an identifier for a complex, long-lived entity, it should be an opaque and immutable identifier, similar to using numerical IDs instead of email addresses as foreign keys in databases.

## Week 50, 2025

- [Own a Graph](https://staysaasy.com/strategy/2025/11/25/own-a-graph.html) - If you are a senior engineer or PM or designer, you should own a graph.
  - Graphs are a critical unit of ownership for senior people to track their progress, communicate outcomes, and get feedback. If you don’t own one, fix that ASAP.
- [Utility First, Component Second](https://mytory.net/archives/17476)
  - 유틸리티 우선 방법론은 컴포넌트 구성 시점을 늦춤으로써, 개발자가 유틸리티로 빠르게 시작하고 중복이 보일 때 컴포넌트를 만드는 '시점'의 문제로 전환했습니다.
  - 유틸리티 우선 방법론에서 'First'는 유틸리티 중시뿐만 아니라, 컴포넌트 구성 시점을 늦추는 관점을 도입하여 CSS 아키텍처의 난제를 해결하는 데 기여했습니다.

- [It’s Always the Process, Stupid!](https://its.promp.td/its-always-the-process-stupid/) - Why AI Won’t Save Your Broken Workflow
  - AI does not inherently make an organization smarter; it only makes processes faster.
  - Implementing AI on a flawed business process will only accelerate the generation of poor outcomes.
  - To effectively use AI for unstructured data, the workflow itself must first be structured and designed.
  - The core recommendation is to map, streamline, and optimize business processes before applying AI to enhance speed.

## Week 48, 2025

- [Credit Report Shows Meta Keeping $27 Billion Off Its Books Through Advanced Geometry](https://stohl.substack.com/p/exclusive-credit-report-shows-meta)
  - Meta is structured to provide all material economic support to the project while keeping approximately $27 billion of assets and debt off its balance sheet.

- [Brain has five ‘eras’, scientists say – with adult mode not starting until early 30s](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/25/brain-human-cognitive-development-life-stages-cambridge-study)
  > [The study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65974-8), based on the brain scans of nearly 4,000 people aged under one to 90, mapped neural connections and how they evolve during our lives. This revealed five broad phases, split up by four pivotal “turning points” in which brain organisation moves on to a different trajectory, at around the ages of nine, 32, 66 and 83 years.
- [A Practical Guide to Blobs, File APIs, and Memory Optimization](https://jsdev.space/howto/blob-file-handling-guide/)

  - Need to **create files on the front end** (JSON, CSV, images, exports)
  - Want to **stream or chunk large files** without loading them fully into memory
  - Implement **image compression or format conversion**
  - Provide a **unified file preview** experience
  - Need safe **download/export** flows for big datasets
  - Care about **long-running apps and memory leaks**
- [Learning from Running](https://blog.get-nerve.com/learning-from-running/)
  - Avoid the 'Bank Metaphor' in training, which assumes linear progress from effort; instead, focus on specific stimuli to trigger physiological adaptations.
  - Aerobic training requires 'low and slow' efforts for adaptation, while anaerobic training demands high intensity, necessitating a balance and majority of time spent at a leisurely pace.
  - Consistency is crucial for long-term improvement, as it signals to the body the need for adaptation and becomes a habit that compounds over time.
  - Improvements in performance are often gradual and non-linear, making it difficult to 'feel' progress from workout to workout, despite underlying changes.
  - Focus on mastering fundamental basics rather than seeking quick hacks or tricks for significant and sustainable improvement.
  - To continue improving, it's essential to step outside your comfort zone and engage in 'desirable difficulties' that challenge you without being overwhelming.
- [Why AC is cheap, but AC repair is a luxury](https://www.a16z.news/p/why-ac-is-cheap-but-ac-repair-is)
  - If you live in the United States today, and you accidentally knock a hole in your wall, it’s probably cheaper to buy a flatscreen TV and stick it in front of the hole, compared to hiring a handyman to fix your drywall.
  - The cheapness of air conditioning (a product of technological abundance) contrasts sharply with the rising cost of repairing it (a labor-intensive service immune to such gains), illustrating how technology reshapes value across the economy.
  - As AI drives productivity in some areas, wages in other sectors will rise, making services like home AC repair more expensive even if the technology for repair hasn't improved.
- [Windows 11 to add an AI agent that runs in background with access to personal folders, warns of security risk](https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/11/18/windows-11-to-add-an-ai-agent-that-runs-in-background-with-access-to-personal-folders-warns-of-security-risk/)
- [Fuel Your Creativity With a Dopamine Menu For Artists](https://gortmanillustration.com/blog/2024/1/10/fuel-your-creativity-with-a-dopamine-menu-for-artists)

- [On the foolishness of "natural language programming".](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html)
  - Formal texts, unlike natural languages, have simple rules for manipulation, making them effective tools for preventing nonsense.
  - Instead of regarding the obligation to use formal symbols as a burden, we should regard the convenience of using them as a privilege: thanks to them, school children can learn to do what in earlier days only genius could achieve.

  > I put a little analog clock on my desk that's set to UTC time. It helps a lot with converting logs to get a quick reference. - [yabones](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45724173)
- [It's insulting to read your AI-generated blog post](https://blog.pabloecortez.com/its-insulting-to-read-your-ai-generated-blog-post/)

  - Making mistakes and learning from them is a fundamentally human experience.
  - AI-generated content creates a sterile barrier between the writer and the reader.
  - This barrier prevents genuine engagement and connection.

  > I personally don’t think I care if a blog post is AI generated or not. The only thing that matters to me is the content. I use ChatGPT to learn about a variety of different things, so if someone came up with an interesting set of prompts and follow ups and shared a summary of the research ChatGPT did, it could be meaningful content to me.
  >
  > > No, don't use it to fix your grammar, or for translations, or for whatever else you think you are incapable of doing. Make the mistake. Feel embarrassed. Learn from it. Why? Because that's what makes us human!
  >
  > It would be more human to handwrite your blog post instead. I don’t see how this is a good argument. The use of tools to help with writing and communication should make it easier to convey your thoughts, and that itself is valuable. - [alyxya](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45723176)

- [Cloudflare’s 2025 Annual Founders’ Letter](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-2025-annual-founders-letter/)
  - The internet's core business model has historically relied on traffic generation (ads, subscriptions) to reward content creators.
  - Traffic has been an imperfect proxy for value, leading to issues like clickbait and ragebait, driven by the need to maximize traffic.
  - The shift from Search Engines to Answer Engines (like AI chatbots) is fundamentally changing internet discovery, providing direct answers instead of links.
    - This transition is causing significant short-term pain for industries reliant on traffic monetization, particularly media companies.
  - A new internet business model is emerging, potentially rewarding creators of unique, original content that fills knowledge gaps identified by AI.

## Week 43, 2025

- [How Complex Systems Fail](https://how.complexsystems.fail)
  - Complex systems always contain latent failures that change over time due to technological and organizational changes.
  - Complex systems operate in a degraded mode, with continuous failures and repairs, making accidents seem inevitable in hindsight.
  - Post-accident analyses often incorrectly attribute failures to a single root cause, overlooking the multiple contributing factors.
  - Hindsight bias affects post-accident assessments, making it difficult to accurately evaluate human performance during the event.
- [Fallout from the AWS outage: Smart mattresses go rogue](https://quasa.io/media/the-strangest-fallout-from-the-aws-outage-smart-mattresses-go-rogue-and-ruin-sleep-worldwide) - An AWS outage caused widespread disruptions, including issues with smart mattresses from Eight Sleep.
- [How Deno protects against npm exploits](https://deno.com/blog/deno-protects-npm-exploits)
  - Deno offers a secure alternative by running code in a sandbox with no OS access by default.
  - Deno requires explicit permissions for file system access, network connections, and environment variables.
  - But, deno's current permission model is applied on a per-project basis, meaning if a project has already granted permissions, a malicious package could exploit those permissions. Fine-grained permission control per package (e.g., per-package permissions) is not yet fully implemented, which prevents complete blocking of supply chain attacks.

## Week 40, 2025

- [Users Only Care About 20% of Your Application](https://idiallo.com/blog/users-only-care-about-20-percent)
  - Users typically only utilize about 20% of an application's features, and **this 20% varies from user to user**.
  - Software often becomes bloated with features that most users don't need, leading to frustration and resentment.
  - VS Code, Slack, and Discord exemplify platforms that provide a foundation for users to customize their experience.
  - Accepting that users will only partially care about your software can lead to more focused and satisfying product development.
  - Embracing the idea that software will be used in unexpected ways can lead to innovative and user-centric design.

  - On the web, footnotes are even more cumbersome due to scrolling and navigation challenges.
  - Readers should be able to easily skip over supplementary content if they choose.

  > For example: [#](https://jakearchibald.com/2025/give-footnotes-the-boot/#comment-6731381255)
  >
  > - 50+% likelihood and content is short? → Parentheses

  - V8의 세대별 객체 승격 메커니즘은 Age-based, Size-based, Pretenuring 등의 복합적인 휴리스틱을 사용하여 객체를 Old Generation으로 승격시킨다.
  - React의 Fiber 아키텍처는 V8의 세대별 가설과 충돌하며, Fiber 노드는 컴포넌트가 마운트된 동안 계속 살아있어 Old Generation으로 승격되어 Major GC 부담을 증가시킨다.
  - React Hooks는 클로저 메모리 누수를 일으킬 수 있으며, useEffect와 같은 훅은 클로저가 전체 컴포넌트 스코프를 캡처하여 메모리 누수를 유발할 수 있다.
  - V8의 Orinoco 프로젝트는 병렬 처리, 증분 처리, 동시 처리 등의 기술을 도입하여 GC pause time을 크게 감소시켰으며, 특히 동시 마킹은 Major GC pause time을 60-70% 감소시켰다.

  1.  Read a byte. If it starts with 0, it's a single-byte character (ASCII). Show the character represented by the remaining 7 bits on the screen. Continue with the next byte.
  2.  If the byte didn't start with a 0, then:
      - If it starts with 110, it's a two-byte character, so read the next byte as well.
      - If it starts with 1110, it's a three-byte character, so read the next two bytes.
      - If it starts with 11110, it's a four-byte character, so read the next three bytes.
  3.  Once the number of bytes are determined, read all the remaining bits except the leading bits, and find the binary value (aka. code point) of the character.
  4.  Look up the code point in the Unicode character set to find the corresponding character and display it on the screen.
  5.  Read the next byte and repeat the process.

- [Does AI Actually Boost Developer Productivity? (100k Devs Study) - Yegor Denisov-Blanch, Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk)
  - **AI's Impact on Developer Productivity**: AI increases developer productivity by roughly 15-20% on average, but this varies based on several factors.
  - **Task Complexity Matters**: AI is more effective for low-complexity tasks, with productivity gains of 30-40%, compared to 10-15% for high-complexity tasks.
  - **Context Window Limitations**: Even with larger context windows, AI performance decreases as the amount of context increases.
  - **Methodology**: The study used a model that automates the evaluation of code changes, making it scalable and affordable compared to manual expert evaluations.
  - **Surveys are Ineffective**: Self-reported surveys are poor predictors of developer productivity, with developers often misjudging their own productivity by about 30 percentile points.

> I swear if I see another "SEO" guy or some rando web dev who joined the workforce after Covid complaining about SPAs by misrepresenting it, I'm gonna explode.  
> As someone who's been developing web apps since the 2000s, let me tell you the origin of SPA has few things to do with the "false promise of SPAs" he listed, but largely due to companies in the late 2000/early 2010s wanting to go "mobile first". This usually meant they still had a desktop second somewhere, which implied they were architecting the entire system to completely separate the frontends and the backend.
>
> Before, what web devs meant by frontend was essentially server-side rendered HTML templates with perhaps a little bit of jQuery running on the client-side. Now, since mobile and desktop web apps are to share some business logic and the database somehow, people had to rediscover REST by reading Roy Fielding's Phd dissertation that inspired the original HTTP. This meant now every company was moving to service-oriented architecture and started exposing their backend APIs onto the open internet so their mobile apps and SPAs running in the browser can share the same APIs. This was a cost saving measure.
>
> This period also coincided with the steady decline of full-stack webapp frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Django because for a couple of years, these frameworks had no good ways to support an API only applications. Django hadn't even reached 1.0 back then. This was a time when NodeJS was really starting to pick up momentum. Once people had started being more comfortable with JS on the server-side, lots of people suddenly realized they could push a lot of business logic to increasing powerful desktop browsers and phones, application hosts people now call "edge devices".

  - Use a simple sprint-planning system: Prioritize tasks in this order: time-critical items, Rocks, Pebbles, and Sand. Adjust as needed based on capacity and the readiness of high-quality stories.
  - Avoid common mistakes: Don't let easy or urgent tasks (Sand) crowd out strategic tasks (Rocks). Also, don't assume that the size of a task determines its priority.

    2. this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but
    3. in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and
    4. breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning.
