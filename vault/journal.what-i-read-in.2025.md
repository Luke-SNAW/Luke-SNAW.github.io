- [How I Almost Got Hacked By A 'Job Interview'](https://blog.daviddodda.com/how-i-almost-got-hacked-by-a-job-interview)
- [They traveled to Thailand. They wound up cyber scam slaves in Myanmar.](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/SOUTHEASTASIA-SCAMS/mypmxwdwwvr/) - Across Southeast Asia, a multibillion-dollar fraud industry has emerged, staffed in part by victims of trafficking.

## Week 41, 2025

## Week 40, 2025

- [Users Only Care About 20% of Your Application](https://idiallo.com/blog/users-only-care-about-20-percent)
  - Users typically only utilize about 20% of an application's features, and **this 20% varies from user to user**.
  - Software often becomes bloated with features that most users don't need, leading to frustration and resentment.
  - VS Code, Slack, and Discord exemplify platforms that provide a foundation for users to customize their experience.
  - Accepting that users will only partially care about your software can lead to more focused and satisfying product development.
  - Embracing the idea that software will be used in unexpected ways can lead to innovative and user-centric design.

## Week 39, 2025

- [시간 관리의 세 단계 진화: 왜 빈 큐를 먼저 만들어야 하는가](https://unnud.com/the-three-stage-evolution-of-time-management-why-you-should-create-an-empty-queue-first/)
  - 시간 구조를 먼저 설계: Deep Work Queue, Creative Queue, Admin Queue
    - 구조는 고정하되 내용은 유연하게 - 이번 주는 기획서, 다음 주는 분석 보고서
    - 좋은 그릇(시간 구조)을 먼저 준비하고 담을 것(할 일)을 고르는 순서의 역전
    - 시간 관리의 비밀은 많이 하는 게 아니라 맞는 일을 맞는 시간에 하는 것
  - 주의
    - 긴 목록이 뇌에 "위험하다"는 신호 → 스트레스 호르몬 분비 → 미루기는 게으름이 아닌 방어 기제
    - 30분 단위는 스트레스 → 90분-2시간 큐가 적정
    - 모든 큐 채우려는 완벽주의 → 70% 채우고 30% 버퍼
- [Give footnotes the boot](https://jakearchibald.com/2025/give-footnotes-the-boot/)

  - Footnotes disrupt the reading flow by requiring readers to navigate away from the main content.
  - On the web, footnotes are even more cumbersome due to scrolling and navigation challenges.
  - Readers should be able to easily skip over supplementary content if they choose.

  > For example: [#](https://jakearchibald.com/2025/give-footnotes-the-boot/#comment-6731381255)
  >
  > - 50+% likelihood and content is short? → Parentheses
  > - 50+% likelihood and content is medium or long? → note block
  > - 20-50% likelihood and content is medium or long? → collapsed note block
  > - < 20% likelihood and content is short or medium? → footnote

## Week 38, 2025

- [V8과 WebAssembly: 현대 자바스크립트 엔진의 구조와 성능 최적화(상하편)](https://www.zigae.com/chrome-gc/)
  - V8의 세대별 힙 구조는 객체의 수명에 따라 최적화된 처리를 가능하게 하며, Young Generation과 Old Generation으로 구분되어 관리된다.
  - V8의 세대별 객체 승격 메커니즘은 Age-based, Size-based, Pretenuring 등의 복합적인 휴리스틱을 사용하여 객체를 Old Generation으로 승격시킨다.
  - React의 Fiber 아키텍처는 V8의 세대별 가설과 충돌하며, Fiber 노드는 컴포넌트가 마운트된 동안 계속 살아있어 Old Generation으로 승격되어 Major GC 부담을 증가시킨다.
  - React Hooks는 클로저 메모리 누수를 일으킬 수 있으며, useEffect와 같은 훅은 클로저가 전체 컴포넌트 스코프를 캡처하여 메모리 누수를 유발할 수 있다.
  - V8의 Orinoco 프로젝트는 병렬 처리, 증분 처리, 동시 처리 등의 기술을 도입하여 GC pause time을 크게 감소시켰으며, 특히 동시 마킹은 Major GC pause time을 60-70% 감소시켰다.

  > Constraint solvers runtimes are unpredictable and almost always slower than an ideal bespoke algorithm because they are more expressive, in what I refer to as the [capability/tractability tradeoff](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/the-capability-tractability-tradeoff/). But even so, they'll do way better than a _bad_ bespoke algorithm, and I'm not experienced enough in handwriting algorithms to consistently beat a solver.
  > The real advantage of solvers, though, is how well they handle new constraints.

- [UTF-8 is a Brilliant Design](https://iamvishnu.com/posts/utf8-is-brilliant-design) - still be backward compatible with ASCII
  1.  Read a byte. If it starts with 0, it's a single-byte character (ASCII). Show the character represented by the remaining 7 bits on the screen. Continue with the next byte.
  2.  If the byte didn't start with a 0, then:
      - If it starts with 110, it's a two-byte character, so read the next byte as well.
      - If it starts with 1110, it's a three-byte character, so read the next two bytes.
      - If it starts with 11110, it's a four-byte character, so read the next three bytes.
  3.  Once the number of bytes are determined, read all the remaining bits except the leading bits, and find the binary value (aka. code point) of the character.
  4.  Look up the code point in the Unicode character set to find the corresponding character and display it on the screen.
  5.  Read the next byte and repeat the process.

- [Does AI Actually Boost Developer Productivity? (100k Devs Study) - Yegor Denisov-Blanch, Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk)
  - **AI's Impact on Developer Productivity**: AI increases developer productivity by roughly 15-20% on average, but this varies based on several factors.
  - **Task Complexity Matters**: AI is more effective for low-complexity tasks, with productivity gains of 30-40%, compared to 10-15% for high-complexity tasks.
  - **Context Window Limitations**: Even with larger context windows, AI performance decreases as the amount of context increases.
  - **Methodology**: The study used a model that automates the evaluation of code changes, making it scalable and affordable compared to manual expert evaluations.
  - **Surveys are Ineffective**: Self-reported surveys are poor predictors of developer productivity, with developers often misjudging their own productivity by about 30 percentile points.

> I swear if I see another "SEO" guy or some rando web dev who joined the workforce after Covid complaining about SPAs by misrepresenting it, I'm gonna explode.  
> As someone who's been developing web apps since the 2000s, let me tell you the origin of SPA has few things to do with the "false promise of SPAs" he listed, but largely due to companies in the late 2000/early 2010s wanting to go "mobile first". This usually meant they still had a desktop second somewhere, which implied they were architecting the entire system to completely separate the frontends and the backend.
>
> Before, what web devs meant by frontend was essentially server-side rendered HTML templates with perhaps a little bit of jQuery running on the client-side. Now, since mobile and desktop web apps are to share some business logic and the database somehow, people had to rediscover REST by reading Roy Fielding's Phd dissertation that inspired the original HTTP. This meant now every company was moving to service-oriented architecture and started exposing their backend APIs onto the open internet so their mobile apps and SPAs running in the browser can share the same APIs. This was a cost saving measure.
>
> This period also coincided with the steady decline of full-stack webapp frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Django because for a couple of years, these frameworks had no good ways to support an API only applications. Django hadn't even reached 1.0 back then. This was a time when NodeJS was really starting to pick up momentum. Once people had started being more comfortable with JS on the server-side, lots of people suddenly realized they could push a lot of business logic to increasing powerful desktop browsers and phones, application hosts people now call "edge devices".

An example of some values I frequently use is "What will give me the most enjoyment the furthest into the future? "What will result in the world being a better place?" "What will make me become someone who resembles Jesus more?" They are different from constraints as they don't knock out any options by default.
