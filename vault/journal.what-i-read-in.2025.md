- [Why Facts Don’t Change Minds in the Culture Wars—Structure Does](https://vasily.cc/blog/facts-dont-change-minds/)
  - Belief Systems as Structures: Belief systems can be visualized as interconnected graphs where core ideas (nodes) and their connections (edges) form a stable, self-reinforcing structure. Challenging a core idea or connection can destabilize the entire system.
  - Historical Example: The Church's resistance to Galileo's heliocentric model was not just about superstition but about protecting a belief structure that underpinned its authority and societal order.

  - Prioritize by impact, not just size: The Rocks, Pebbles, Sand framework emphasizes prioritizing tasks based on their strategic impact rather than just their size or urgency.
  - Use a simple sprint-planning system: Prioritize tasks in this order: time-critical items, Rocks, Pebbles, and Sand. Adjust as needed based on capacity and the readiness of high-quality stories.
  - Avoid common mistakes: Don't let easy or urgent tasks (Sand) crowd out strategic tasks (Rocks). Also, don't assume that the size of a task determines its priority.

  - Before giving feedback, assess your own role in the situation and consider if the issue is worth addressing.
  - Use the "even more" technique to frame feedback positively, suggesting enhancements rather than criticizing past actions.
  - Share personal experiences instead of directly telling the leader what to do to reduce defensiveness.
  - Employ diplomatic language that invites collaboration, such as "What are your thoughts on..." or "Perhaps we could..."
  - Offer concrete examples and data to support your feedback, making it more persuasive and actionable.
  - Position your feedback to focus on future improvements rather than past mistakes to prevent a defensive reaction.
- [Why Generative AI Coding Tools and Agents Do Not Work For Me](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/why-generative-ai-coding-tools-and-agents-do-not-work-for-me)
  - reviewing AI-generated code takes as much time as writing code from scratch, if not more.
  - interns learn and improve over time, while AI does not retain knowledge from past tasks.
  - Claims that AI increases speed or productivity often come from lowering quality standards while accepting additional risks, or stem from the interests of AI vendors.

  > One person sets a goal: become a best-selling author. Another imposes a constraint: write every day, but never write what bores me.

The constraints are what made it a hard problem, but the only reason they were able to hit this goal in an impossibly short timeline is the huge amount of resources that they put toward a very clear goal (which was, honestly, less "let man explore the heavens" than "beat the Soviets"). — [#](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44237540&how=un&auth=51df6f06022c423f1c5abe96dab72810e7a7f3c5&goto=item%3Fid%3D44232714#44237540)

  > I agree with the author, but I would also say there is something above goals and constraints. Values. A set of things that, when comparing multiple options, make the choice clear. An example of some values I frequently use is "What will give me the most enjoyment the furthest into the future? "What will result in the world being a better place?" "What will make me become someone who resembles Jesus more?" They are different from constraints as they don't knock out any options by default. Instead, they make triaging when there are many different things I could be doing much easier, and circumvent my messy intuition which is based on hormones, hunger, weather, etc.  
  > I think values, goals, and constraints are all valuable, but it's a hierarchy. We should create constraints that help us become more aligned with our values. We should create shorter-term goals that make it easy to stay within our constraints. — [#](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44236709)

- [How to Use Em Dashes (–), En Dashes (–), and Hyphens (-)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/em-dash-en-dash-how-to-use)
  > - Hyphens connect things, such as compound words: double-decker, cut-and-dried, 212-555-5555.
  > - EN dashes make a range between things: Boston–San Francisco flight, 10–20 years: both connect not only the endpoints, but define that all the space between is included. (Compare the last usage with the phone number example under Hyphens.)
  > - EM dashes break things, such as sentences or thoughts: 'What the—!'; A paragraph should express one idea—but rules are made to be broken.

    1. AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents,
    2. this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but
    3. in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and
    4. breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning.
