  > HTTP/3 has seen rapid adoption due to being used by major companies like Google and Meta. It uses the QUIC protocol, which improves on TCP by more extensively encrypting metadata and enabling faster connection setup. QUIC also enhances performance by eliminating issues like head-of-line blocking and improving network handling. While HTTP/3 was created to work over QUIC, the true innovation was QUIC itself, which updates TCP with security and efficiency improvements. QUIC encryption makes it easier to update features, since middleboxes cannot access metadata. Overall, QUIC and HTTP/3 enhance web performance and security by modernizing core Internet protocols.

- [Dear Developer, the Web Isn’t About You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYXSck7TyVM)
  - The web was originally simple, robust and accessible to all due to technologies like HTML working together in a layered manner.
  - Over-engineering websites with complex JavaScript frameworks makes the web fragile and excludes many users.
  - Performance and accessibility are major issues for many users but not priorities for most developers.
  - "Moving fast and breaking things" prioritizes developers over users and can exclude people from the web.
  - Researching user needs upfront through UX instead of just coding could lead to more useful websites.
  - The web is heterogeneous, not a controlled platform, so it requires an approach that acknowledges its diversity.
  - Simple, progressive techniques like serving HTML first make sites robust and usable for all.
  - The goal is caring for all people who use the web, not prioritizing new technologies.

  > WebP was more prone to posterization and artifacts, especially on photos with smooth gradients.  
  > For similar visual quality on a portrait photo, WebP was actually 30-39% heavier than JPEG.  
  > WebP is not necessarily better than JPEG for all photographic use cases.
