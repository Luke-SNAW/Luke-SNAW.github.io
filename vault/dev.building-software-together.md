Our aim is to teach you how to be a _compassionate programmer_: one who cares as much about the well-being of their colleagues and users as they do about their own. This focus is not entirely altruistic—everything you do to help others also helps your future self—but now that we all know how much harm software can do, we hope you'll be interested in some practical idealism.
