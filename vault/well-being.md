  - Resting less than 2 minutes increases cortisol production and worsens the T:C ratio, which is related to muscle growth.
  - Training each muscle at least twice a week is necessary for maximum muscle growth.
  - The traditional bro bodybuilding idea of the hypertrophy zone (6-12 reps) is not supported by evidence.
  - Training with a wide range of rep ranges may result in more muscle growth than always sticking with 8-12 reps per set.
  - Training to volitional interruption is just as effective for muscle growth as training to complete momentary muscle failure.
  - Training to failure can be beneficial, but your total training volume is what matters most.
  - High carb diets are popular among bodybuilders, but it makes it hard to see if you're looking bigger because of your training or because of your higher carb intake.
  - Training intensity is confusingly defined as the percentage of your one repetition maximum (% 1RM) with which you're training.
