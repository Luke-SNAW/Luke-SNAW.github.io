Life is short and your project is even shorter, so this book focuses on the things that will help you the most in the short term:

- How to work effectively in a small team when you are constantly being interrupted by other tasks like the homework for your other courses.
- What tools you should use to build, test, deploy, and describe software in less time and with less pain.
- How to design a program (or a set of related programs) that will take several weeks to write.
- How a few simple changes in your study habits will enable you to learn more and more quickly.
- What legal rights you have to the software you create as a student (and on the job).
- What to do when things go wrong.

We have included other material as well, since there is a lot of variation between project courses and even more between the people doing them. Throughout, we are guided by a modified version of [Dobzhansky's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_in_Biology_Makes_Sense_Except_in_the_Light_of_Evolution):

> Nothing in software engineering makes sense except in the light of psychology.
