- [Users Only Care About 20% of Your Application](https://idiallo.com/blog/users-only-care-about-20-percent)
  - Users typically only utilize about 20% of an application's features, and **this 20% varies from user to user**.
  - Software often becomes bloated with features that most users don't need, leading to frustration and resentment.
  - VS Code, Slack, and Discord exemplify platforms that provide a foundation for users to customize their experience.
  - Accepting that users will only partially care about your software can lead to more focused and satisfying product development.
  - Embracing the idea that software will be used in unexpected ways can lead to innovative and user-centric design.
