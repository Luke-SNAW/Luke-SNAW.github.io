### [Reflex](https://github.com/cespare/reflex)

Run a command when files change

> I have been using reflex https://github.com/cespare/reflex for the same thing in some of our docker projects

> +1 for reflex, love being able to have a config for development  
> Example .reflex.conf to run one command when an openapi spec changes and another when any go files change:

```shell
-g "spec.yaml" -- bash -c 'make'
-sr "\.go$" -- go run cmd/app/main.go
```

Then run it with:

```shell
reflex -d fancy -c .reflex.conf
```

#### Why you should use reflex instead

- Reflex has no dependencies. No need to install Ruby or anything like that.
- Reflex uses an appropriate file watching mechanism to watch for changes efficiently on your platform.
- Reflex gives your command the name of the file that changed.
- No DSL to learn -- just give it a shell command.
- No plugins.
- Not tied to any language, framework, workflow, or editor.
