## Type safety

> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33986555
> This is how I move fast and break nothing. By having fullstack type-safety from database all the way to the frontend with auto-completion. My current stack:

- SvelteKit (could be Next, Nuxt, Solid or any other TypeScript framework)
- tRPC (typed calls between frontend and backend, https://trpc.io)
- trpc-sveltekit (glues SvelteKit and tRPC, https://github.com/icflorescu/trpc-sveltekit)
- Prisma (ORM, https://www.prisma.io)
