## Week 7, 2026

- [Why is the sky blue?](https://explainers.blog/posts/why-is-the-sky-blue/) - And the sunset red? But the Martian sky red and sunset blue?
  - The sky appears blue because blue photons from sunlight are scattered more by Earth's atmosphere than other colors, dispersing them throughout the sky.
  - The preferential scattering of blue light is due to the resonant frequencies of nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere, which are closer to the frequency of blue light.
  - Violet light scatters even more than blue light, but the sky appears blue rather than violet because human eyes are less sensitive to violet light.
  - Sunsets appear red because the sunlight travels through more atmosphere, scattering away most of the blue and green light, leaving primarily red light to reach our eyes.

  > - Everybody wants to write a greenfield demo. Nobody wants to run a service.
  >   - The first 90% to get a working demo is easy. It's the other 190% that matters.
  > - People don't buy software, they hire a service. - result
- [The '3.5% rule': How a small minority can change the world](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)
  - Nonviolent protests are twice as likely to succeed as armed conflicts.
  - Civil resistance involving a threshold of 3.5% of the population actively participating has never failed to bring about change.
  - Erica Chenoweth's research analyzed hundreds of campaigns over the last century to compare the success rates of nonviolent versus violent protests.
    > - Chenoweth has backed off her previous conclusions in recent years, observing that nonviolent protest strategies have dramatically declined in effectiveness as governments have adjusted their tactics of repression and messaging.

- [The Influentists](https://carette.xyz/posts/influentists/) - The trend of 'hype first and context later' is characterized by individuals called 'The Influentists' who leverage large audiences to propagate unproven or misleading claims.
  > - Doesn't the existence of consumer products like ChatGPT indicate that LLMs aren't able to do human-level work? If OpenAI really had a digital workforce with the capabilities of ~100k programmers/scientists/writers/lawyers/doctors etc, wouldn't the most profitable move be to utilize those "workers" directly, rather that renting out their skills piecemeal? - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46624115
- [Our approach to advertising and expanding access to ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-e
  > - This sounds exactly like what Google used to say about search results. Just a few ads, clearly separated from organic results, never detracting from the core mission of providing the most effective access to all the world’s information. (And certainly not driven by a secret profile of you based on pervasive surveillance of your internet activity.) - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46650756
  > - People are reacting negatively to the ads, but there's a bigger point. This is bearish as heck for AGI. If OpenAI were recursively improving their general-computer-using agent, who was going to be superhuman at every job, they wouldn't need to be messing around with things like this. - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46653567
