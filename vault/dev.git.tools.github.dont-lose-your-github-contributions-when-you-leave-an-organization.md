# [It is important to understand when commits are shown](https://vikrantbhat.hashnode.dev/dont-lose-your-github-contributions-when-you-leave-an-organization#heading-it-is-important-to-understand-when-commits-are-shown)

Commits will appear on your contributions graph if they meet all of the following conditions:

1. The email address used for the commits is associated with your account on [GitHub.com](http://github.com/).
2. The commits were made in a standalone repository, not a fork.
3. The commits were made in the repository's default branch

In addition, at least one of the following must be true:

- You are a collaborator on the repository or are a member of the organization that owns the repository.
- You have forked the repository.
- You have opened a pull request or issue in the repository.
- ✨ **You have starred the repository.** ✨

# [So what can I do to keep my hard-earned contributions?](https://vikrantbhat.hashnode.dev/dont-lose-your-github-contributions-when-you-leave-an-organization#heading-so-what-can-i-do-to-keep-my-hard-earned-contributions)

Star the repositories you are contributing to in your organization. That way, your commits to those repositories will remain in your contributions graph even if you leave the organization that owns the repository or delete your fork of the repository.

# [Before you leave your company, make sure you update the following information in your personal account:](https://vikrantbhat.hashnode.dev/dont-lose-your-github-contributions-when-you-leave-an-organization#heading-before-you-leave-your-company-make-sure-you-update-the-following-information-in-your-personal-account)

1. Unverify your company email address by deleting it in your Email settings. You can then re-add it without verifying to keep any associated commits linked to your account.
2. Change your primary email address from your company email to your personal email.
3. Verify your new primary email address.

1. Regarding the advice to star the repos before leaving, does this mean that only commits post-starring will remain? Or is starring once sufficient to retain all past commits?

Ans - all commits will remain, so star the repositories as soon as you can just in case.

2. What if commits were made using a company email?

Ans - Unverify your company email address by deleting it in your Email settings. You can then re-add it without verifying to keep any associated commits linked to your account.
