Tailwind is UGLY!

It’s tedious, hard to read, and hard to organize.

“traditional Italian meal consisting of long thin wheat noodles, tomatoes that have been turned into a liquid, and small chunks of beef that have been shaped into spheres”. This is how utility classes work. I’d rather just order “spaghetti and meatballs” and call it a day. 🤷‍♂️🍝
